  abstract = {This review article summarizes the current state-of-the-art for biomimicry in additive manufacturing. Biomimicry is the practice of learning from and emulating nature - which can be increasingly realized in engineering applications due to progress in additive manufacturing (AM). AM has grown tremendously in recent years, with improvements in technology and resulting material properties sometimes exceeding those of equivalent parts produced by traditional production processes. This has led to the industrial use of AM parts even in highly critical applications, most notably in aerospace, automotive and medical applications. The ability to create parts with complex geometries is one of the most important advantages of this technology, allowing the production of complex functional objects from various materials including plastics and metals that cannot be easily produced by any other means. Utilizing the full complexity allowed by AM is the key to unlocking the huge potential of this technology for real world applications \textendash{} and biomimicry might be pivotal in this regard. Biomimicry may take different forms in AM, including customization of parts for individuals (e.g. medical prosthesis, implants or custom sports equipment), or optimization for specific properties such as stiffness and light-weighting (e.g. lightweight parts in aerospace or automotive applications). The optimization process often uses an iterative simulation-driven process analogous to biological evolution \textendash{} with an improvement in every iteration. Other forms of biomimicry in AM include the incorporation of real biological inputs into designs (i.e. emulating nature for its unique properties); the use of cellular or lattice structures \textendash{} for various applications and customized to the application; incorporating multi-functionality into designs; the consolidation of numerous parts into one and the reduction of waste, amongst others. Numerous biomimetic design approaches may be used \textendash{} broadly categorized into customized/freeform, simulation-driven and lattice designs. All these approaches may be used in combination with one another, and in all cases with or without direct input from nature. The aim of this review is to unravel the different forms of biomimetic engineering that are now possible \textendash{} focusing mainly on functional mechanical engineering for end-use parts, i.e. not for prototyping. The current limits of each design approach are discussed and the most exciting future opportunities for biomimetic AM applications are highlighted.},

  abstract = {Various upper-limb prostheses have been designed for 3D printing but only a few of them are based on bio-inspired design principles and many anatomical details are not typically incorporated even though 3D printing offers advantages that facilitate the application of such design principles. We therefore aimed to apply a bio-inspired approach to the design and fabrication of articulated fingers for a new type of 3D printed hand prosthesis that is body-powered and complies with basic user requirements. We first studied the biological structure of human fingers and their movement control mechanisms in order to devise the transmission and actuation system. A number of working principles were established and various simplifications were made to fabricate the hand prosthesis using a fused deposition modelling (FDM) 3D printer with dual material extrusion. We then evaluated the mechanical performance of the prosthetic device by measuring its ability to exert pinch forces and the energy dissipated during each operational cycle. We fabricated our prototypes using three polymeric materials including PLA, TPU, and Nylon. The total weight of the prosthesis was 92\,g with a total material cost of 12\,US dollars. The energy dissipated during each cycle was 0.380\,Nm with a pinch force of {$\approx$}16\,N corresponding to an input force of 100\,N. The hand is actuated by a conventional pulling cable used in BP prostheses. It is connected to a shoulder strap at one end and to the coupling of the whiffle tree mechanism at the other end. The whiffle tree mechanism distributes the force to the four tendons, which bend all fingers simultaneously when pulled. The design described in this manuscript demonstrates several bio-inspired design features and is capable of performing different grasping patterns due to the adaptive grasping provided by the articulated fingers. The pinch force obtained is superior to other fully 3D printed body-powered hand prostheses, but still below that of conventional body powered hand prostheses. We present a 3D printed bio-inspired prosthetic hand that is body-powered and includes all of the following characteristics: adaptive grasping, articulated fingers, and minimized post-printing assembly. Additionally, the low cost and low weight make this prosthetic hand a worthy option mainly in locations where state-of-the-art prosthetic workshops are absent.},

  abstract = {3D printing is an emerging and disruptive technology, supporting the field of medicine over the past decades. In the recent years, the use of additive manufacturing (AM) has had a strong impact on everyday dental applications. Despite remarkable previous results from interdisciplinary research teams, there is no evidence or recommendation about the proper fabrication of handheld medical devices using desktop 3D printers. The aim of this study was to critically examine and compare the mechanical behavior of materials printed with FFF (fused filament fabrication) and CFR (continuous fiber reinforcement) additive manufacturing technologies, and to create and evaluate a massive and practically usable right upper molar forceps. Flexural and torsion fatigue tests, as well as Shore D measurements, were performed. The tensile strength was also measured in the case of the composite material. The flexural tests revealed the measured force values to have a linear correlation with the bending between the 10 mm (17.06 N at 5000th cycle) and 30 mm (37.99 N at 5000th cycle) deflection range. The findings were supported by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images. Based on the results of the mechanical and structural tests, a dental forceps was designed, 3D printed using CFR technology, and validated by five dentists using a Likert scale. In addition, the vertical force of extraction was measured using a unique molar tooth model, where the reference test was carried out using a standard metal right upper molar forceps. Surprisingly, the tests revealed there to be no significant differences between the standard (84.80 N {$\pm$} 16.96 N) and 3D-printed devices (70.30 N {$\pm$} 4.41 N) in terms of extraction force in the tested range. The results also highlighted that desktop CFR technology is potentially suitable for the production of handheld medical devices that have to withstand high forces and perform load-bearing functions.},

The pharmaceutical industry is no exception, and the approval of the first 3D-printed tablet (Spiratam\textregistered ) marked a revolution in the field. Several studies reported the fabrication of different dosage forms using a range of 3D printing techniques. Thermosensitive drugs compose a considerable segment of available medications in the market requiring strict temperature control during processing to ensure their efficacy and safety. Heating involved in some of the 3D printing technologies raises concerns regarding the feasibility of the techniques for printing thermolabile drugs. Studies reported that semi-solid extrusion (SSE) is the commonly used printing technique to fabricate thermosensitive drugs. Digital light processing (DLP), binder jetting (BJ), and stereolithography (SLA) can also be used for the fabrication of thermosensitive drugs as they do not involve heating elements. Nonetheless, degradation of some drugs by light source used in the techniques was reported. Interestingly, fused deposition modelling (FDM) coupled with filling techniques offered protection against thermal degradation. Concepts such as selection of low melting point polymers, adjustment of printing parameters, and coupling of more than one printing technique were exploited in printing thermosensitive drugs. This systematic review presents challenges, 3DP procedures, and future directions of 3D printing of thermo-sensitive formulations.},

  abstract = {Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene (PP) are incompatible thermoplastics due to differences in chemical structure and polarity hence their blends posses inferior mechanical properties. Compatibilization with a suitable block/graft copolymer is one way to improve the mechanical properties especially impact strength of such a blend. In this work, the effects of two compatibilizers, maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene (PP-g-MAH) and maleic anhydride grafted styrene-ethylene/butylene-styrene (SEBS-g-MAH), were investigated for compatibilization of PET/PP blends and the results were compared. PET, PP, and compatibilizers were melt blended in a single step using a counter-rotating twin screw extruder with compatibilizer concentrations 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 phr, respectively. Standard test samples were prepared by injection molding process. The resulting compatibilized blends were characterized by tensile, flexural, and impact tests. The results showed improvements in mechanical properties of the blends due to the in situ polymerization reaction between the ester groups of PET and the maleic anhydride (MAH) during melt extrusi\'on. The incorporation of 4 phr PP-g-MAH in the blends resulted in the highest tensile and flexural strength, while no significant improvements in Young's modulus were observed for both compatibilized blends. The m\'aximum impact strength of the blends was obtained at 8 phr of SEBS-g-MAH. Improvement of impact strength of the blends may be attributed to the elastomeric nature of the SEBS-g-MAH while greater improvement recorded for tensile and flexural strength is likely to be due to the affinity between PP-g-MAH with PP of the blend. Scanning electron microscopy shows the addition of PP-g-MAH and SEBS-g-MAH compatibilizers into the blends promote a better dispersi\'on of PP into PET matrix.},

  abstract = {3D printing is a popular technique for fabricating three-dimensional solid objects from a digital design. In order to produce high quality 3D printed parts, the appropriate selection of printing parameters is crucial. This research is focused on studying the properties of 3D printed specimens (i.e., mechanical, thermal and morphological) with varying processing conditions such as infill pattern, infill density and infill speed, and also with different printing materials. A number of testing techniques such as tensile, bending, compression, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), thermal imaging, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used for performing a comprehensive analysis. The results showed that Young's modulus of the printed parts increased with the increase of infill density. For pure PLA, parts with 100\% infill density obtained the highest Young's modulus of 1538.05~MPa. Of the tested infill speeds from 70 to 110~mm/s; 90~mm/s infill speed gave the highest Young's modulus for pure PLA. Meanwhile, there was a slight difference of Young's modulus between low speeds (70~mm/s and 80~mm/s) and high speeds (100~mm/s and 110~mm/s) compared to the commonly used infill speed of 90~mm/s. The level of crystallinity of the 3D printed PLA specimens did not directly influence the mechanical properties as was confirmed by the DSC results. SEM images showed that the strength of the printed samples was dependent upon the arrangement of their layers. Furthermore, it was found that the most appropriate processing temperature and infill speed for pure PLA filament are 215~\textdegree C and 90~mm/s, respectively. Among the five printing materials tested, carbon fibre reinforced PLA (CFR-PLA) gave the highest Young's modulus of 2637.29~MPa~at 90~mm/s. Voids inside the matrix and the gaps between layers lead to initiation of cracks of the specimens. Overall, 100\% infill density, 90~mm/s infill speed, 215~\textdegree C of set nozzle temperature, and the linear fill pattern were the possible optimal process settings for the most improved performance of the five different printing materials used in this study.},

Using this blend along with the 3D printing method to make complex shapes can have a high potential in medical applications such as stents, so the goal of the following study is to investigate the shape memory properties of Polylactic Acid/Thermoplastic polyurethane (PLA/TPU) blend. The printed samples with 100/0, 80/20, and 60/40 PLA/TPU composition ratios were comprehensively evaluated based on their structural, thermal, and shape memory properties. A differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) test was conducted to determine the glass transition temperatures and crystallization temperature zone of the blends. A full factorial design of experiments was employed to investigate the effect of three variables called composition ratio, printing angle, and filling percentage on shape memory behavior. Using the three-point flexural test, the shape memory behavior of printed samples with composition ratios 100/0,80/20, 60/40, and filling percentages of 50, 75, and 100\%, along with printing angles of zero, {$\pm$}45, and 90\textdegree, was evaluated and measured. The annealing process increased the force required to change the shape and crystallization percentage, such that not being processed, no crystals were observed in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of the samples, while after being annealed, up to 38\% of the crystals were formed. Increasing the percentage of TPU and temperature led to the softening of the samples, reducing the strength and elastic modulus, as well. Enhancing the percentage of TPU also decreases the hydrophilic properties of the samples. The results showed that the best shape memory performance is related to the 20 weight percentage of TPU composition, and the maximum recovery force ratio belongs to the sample with such a composition, zero printing angles, and 75\% filling percentage, which equals 81.56\%, while it equals 74\% using compression molding (CM) in all three production blends.},

Specimens of PP/r-PET blends in different percentages, i.e., 90/10, 70/30, and 50/50 were prepared in a corotating twin-screw extruder to evaluate the mechanical properties. Results indicated that PP-g-MA improved compatibilization of the PP/r-PET blends (modulus of elasticity and yield stress were enhanced to about 1450~MPa and 30~MPa) and also enhanced the morphological and mechanical properties. By adding about 2\% of the compatibilizer into specimens containing 10\% of r-PET, the highest enhancement in mechanical properties was achieved. Besides, both yield strength and the impact of energy were improved 8.3\% and 24.6\% by increasing the amount of 50\% and 10\% r-PET in the system. Also, results showed that specimens have higher yield stress and modulus of elasticity after 10~days compared to those specimens without aging due to the presence of stronger interaction after a period of time.},

  abstract = {Development of new product design principles is crucial for obtaining pharmaceutical products with controlled functionality. Four different molds were designed using a computer-aided design (CAD) software and 3D printed with polylactic acid (PLA). A hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) and polyethylene glycol (PEG)\textendash based formulation containing indomethacin as the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) was casted into the molds. Each mold produced a tablet that was designed to disintegrate into a defined number of sections (2, 4, and 6). This was achieved by incorporating break lines (regions that were significantly thinner than the remainder of the tablet) to control the disintegration process. Disintegration and drug release from these designed tablets was contrasted with a casted tablet without break lines. Disintegration studies confirmed that the casted tablets disintegrated according to their design. Drug-release studies meanwhile demonstrated that tablets with a greater number of sections released the API at a faster rate than those with fewer sections; for example, the 6-sectioned tablet released the API at twice the rate of the tablet without any break lines. It is expected that by using this concept, it would be possible to produce tablets with a designed disintegration profile, which could potentially allow the tailoring of the drug release.},

  abstract = {Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) is a major constituent of the plastic waste generated on a day-to-day basis. Replacing a proportion of the virgin Polypropylene (PP) with recycled Polyethylene Terephthalate (r-PET) through polymer blending is cost-effective and sustainable method to increase the mechanical characteristics of PP. A compatibilizer namely Polypropylene grafted maleic anhydride (PP-g-MAH) is utilized to reduce immiscibility between them through chemical reactions involving the maleic anhydride group. In this study, PP/r-PET blend ratio is maintained at 80/20. The polymer blends prepared by twin screw extrusion are converted to test specimens by injection moulding. The mechanical and thermal properties of the blends are studied by performing characterization techniques like Tensile Tests and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis shows the reaction occurring at the interface during compatibilization. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) suggests the significance of compatibilizer in the microstructure development of the blend for the effective dispersion of the r-PET in PP. The crystallization temperature of PP is moved to higher temperatures in the presence of both the r-PET and the compatibilizer as evident from the DSC analysis. The addition of the compatibilizer improved the tensile strength, elongation at break and the modulus of elasticity of the blend. The blend containing 4\% PP-g-MAH exhibited the optimum set of properties.},

Presently, there is no other technology available, which is either superior or even comparable to the conventional CMP. The present study was designed to fabricate ocular prosthesis using computer aided design (CAD) and rapid manufacturing (RM) technology and to compare it with custom made prosthesis (CMP). The ocular prosthesis prepared by CAD was compared with conventional CMP in terms of time taken for fabrication, weight, cosmesis, comfort, and motility. Two eyes of two patients were included. Computerized tomography scan of wax model of socket was converted into three dimensional format using Materialize Interactive Medical Image Control System (MIMICS)software and further refined. This was given as an input to rapid manufacturing machine (Polyjet 3-D printer). The final painting on prototype was done by an ocularist. The average effective time required for fabrication of CAD prosthesis was 2.5 hours; and weight 2.9 grams. The same for CMP were 10 hours; and 4.4 grams. CAD prosthesis was more comfortable for both the patients. The study demonstrates the first ever attempt of fabricating a complete ocular prosthesis using CAD and rapid manufacturing and comparing it with conventional CMP. This prosthesis takes lesser time for fabrication, and is more comfortable. Studies with larger sample size will be required to further validate this technique.},

Fused granular fabrication (FGF), where plastic granules are directly three-dimensional (3D) printed, has become a promising technique for the AM technology.

The objective of this work is to evaluate the performance of the FFF and FGF techniques in terms of technical and economical dimensions at the desktop 3D printing scale. Recycled and virgin polylactic acid material was studied by using five different types of recycling feedstocks: commercial filament, pellets, distributed filament, distributed pellets, and shredded waste. The results showed that the mechanical properties from the FGF technique using same configurations showed no statistical differences to FFF samples. Nevertheless, the granulometry could have an influence on the reproducibility of the samples, which explains that the critical factor in this technology is to assure the material input in the feeding system. In addition, FGF costs per kg of material were reduced to less than 1 e/kg compared with more than 20 e/kg for commercial recycled filament. These results are encouraging to foster FGF printer diffusion among heavy users of 3D printers because of reducing the cost associated to the filament fabrication while ensuring the technical quality.

  abstract = {Purpose This study aims to investigate the mechanical, thermal, melt-flow and morphological behavior of acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS)-based composites after bentonite inclusions. Melt mixing is the most preferred production method in industrial scale and basically it has very near processing parameters compared to 3D printing applications. Rheological parameters of ABS and its composites are important for 3D applications. Melt flow behavior of ABS effects the fabrication of 3D printed product at desired levels. Shear thinning and non-Newtonian viscosity characteristics of ABS make viscosity control easier and more flexible for several processing techniques including injection molding, compression molding and 3D printing. Design/methodology/approach ABS copolymer was reinforced with bentonite mineral (BNT) at four different loading ratios of 5\%, 10\%, 15\% and 20\%. ABS/BNT composites were fabricated by lab-scale micro-compounder followed by injection molding process. Mechanical, thermo-mechanical, thermal, melt-flow and morphological properties of composites were investigated by tensile, hardness and impact tests, dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), melt flow index (MFI) test and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), respectively. Findings Mechanical tests revealed that tensile strength, elongation and hardness of ABS were enhanced as BNT content increased. Glass transition temperature and storage modulus of ABS exhibited increasing trend with the additions of BNT. However, impact strength values dropped down with BNT inclusion. According to MFI test measurements, BNT incorporation displayed no significant change for MFI value of ABS. Homogeneous dispersion of BNT particles into ABS phase was deduced from SEM micrographs of composites. Loading ratio of 15\% BNT was remarked as the most suitable candidate among fabricated ABS-based composites according to findings. Research limitations/implications The advanced mechanical properties and easy processing characteristics are the reasons for usage of ABS as an engineering plastic. Owing to the increase in its usage for 3D printing technology, the ABS became popular in recent years. The utilization of ABS in this technology is in filament form with various colors and dimensions. This is because of its proper rheological features. Practical implications Melt-mixing technique was used as preparation of composites, as this processing method is widely applied in industry. This method is also providing similar processing methodology with 3D printing technology. Originality/value According to the literature survey, to the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first research work regarding the melt-flow performance of ABS-based composites to evaluate their 3D printing applications and processability. ABS and BNT containing composites were characterized by tensile, impact and shore hardness tests, DMA, TGA), MFI test and SEM techniques.},

The proposed method enables the decoupling of bond quality and mesostructure effects on the overall fracture behavior. Double cantilever beam specimens of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) were designed, printed, and fracture tested. The apparent fracture resistance (Jc,a), the interlayer fracture resistance (Jc,i), and the microstructure were characterized. The fracture results and the microscopic examinations indicate that Jc,a is strongly correlated with the process parameters through both the interlayer adhesion as well as the mesostructure. Nozzle and bed temperatures and layer height were found to have significant effects on the fracture behavior. For instance, the Jc,a increased by 38\% with a 20\,\textdegree C increase in the nozzle temperature. This originated from 15\% increase in the interlayer fracture resistance and 23\% increase in the actual fracture surface area (interlayer neck size). The quality of interlayer bond was explained in terms of temperature, pressure, and time of the process. This work quantifies the relationships between the printing process and the fracture behavior and provides novel tools and insights in the design and analysis of printed materials.},

Specially designed 3D-printed compact tension specimens were tested normal to, and along, the direction of extruded filaments. Higher strength and toughness were found in the filament direction. These differences disappeared when small grooves, comparable to micro-features, were introduced in specimens tested along the former direction to replicate grooves that naturally occur between filaments/layers.

According to infrared spectroscopy results, whereas PP-g-MA was merely capable of reacting with hydroxyl groups of PET, epoxy groups of EBGMA could react with both the hydroxyl and carboxyl end groups of PET. The enhanced compatibilizing effect of EBGMA on PET/PP systems over PP-g-MA was also revealed by scanning electron microscopy and mechanical experiments. From frequency and temperature sweep rheological experiments, the dynamic characteristics of the compatibilized blends found to be improved in comparison with those of the uncompatibilized system.

Compatibilization of polymer blends is also discussed due to its importance in recycling of plastic materials. Since esthetic appearance of finished products is of great concern, different coloring technologies are also reported herein, ranging from standard to ``special effect'' formulations. In the final section a remark on bio-based additives is provided, to account for the social and technological push toward biopolymers and all bio-based formulations.

  abstract = {With the 26\% annual growth rate of additive manufacturing, especially in the area of 3D polymer printing, the amount of waste is increasing at a rapid rate. Limited research in the area of recycling has been produced, yet there are several recycling machines being developed for home use. Despite this work there is no published mechanical data on components produced with filament recycled from 3D printed parts. There is very limited data on mechanical properties of any 3D printed materials. This article compares the properties of parts 3D printed with virgin polylactic acid (PLA) to those printed with recycled PLA. Using commercially available PLA and an entry level 3D printer, tensile and shear specimens were produced and then tested for tensile yield strength, modulus of elasticity, shear yield strength, and hardness. The specimens were then ground up and re-extruded into filament, and a second set of specimens were produced and tested using this recycled PLA filament. Mechanical testing showed that 3D printing with recycled PLA is a viable option. With the recycled filament, tensile strength decreased 10.9\%, shear strength increased 6.8\%, and hardness decreased 2.4\%. The tensile modulus of elasticity was statistically unchanged. Although the average mechanical properties before and after recycling were similar, there was more variability in the results of the recycled filament. Additionally, when printing with the recycled filament there was some nozzle clogging, while none occurred with the virgin filament. Overall, the mechanical properties of specimens 3D printed from recycled PLA filament were similar to virgin properties, encouraging further development in the area of recycling 3D printed filament.},

However, the lack of an open-source metal alternative and the high capital costs and slow throughput of proprietary commercialized metal 3-D printers has severely restricted their deployment. The applications of commercialized metal 3-D printers are limited to only rapid prototyping and expensive finished products.

This paper reports on the development of a {$<\$$}2000 open-source metal 3-D printer.

The bill of materials, electrical and mechanical design schematics, and basic construction and operating procedures are provided. A preliminary technical analysis of the properties of the 3-D printer and the resultant steel products are performed. The results of printing customized functional metal parts are discussed and conclusions are drawn about the potential for the technology and the future work necessary for the mass distribution of this technology.},

Findings \textendash{} In addition to producing fused filament parts, the platform successfully produced milled printed circuit boards, milled plastic objects, objects made with paste extrudates, such as silicone, food stuffs and ceramics, pen plotted works and cut vinyl products. The multi-purpose tool saved 90-97 per cent of the capital costs of functionally equivalent dedicated tools.

Originality/value \textendash{} The unique combination of relatively simple modifications to an existing platform has produced a machine having capabilities far exceeding that of any single commercial product.

PP/PET blends: 80:20 w/w, 50:50 w/w and 20:80 w/w were prepared in an internal mixer for mechanical properties, thermal properties, morphology and rheological properties. SEBS-g-MA promoted compatibilization of the PP/PET blends and improved their properties. With an increasing compatibilization level, the refinement of morphology was observed in the PET rich blend. Compatibilized blends showed negative deviation in the PET glass transition temperature related to neat PET, demonstrating that compatibilization was very successful. PET crystallization was accelerated in the blends due to PP presence that enhanced nucleation. It was found that the 50/50/20 blend showed huge potential for textile fiber application and that of 80/20/20 showed more intermediary properties than neat polymers.},

The interface modification was promoted by blending PP with a small concentration (5\% by weight) of poly(ethylene terephthalate-co-isophthalate) (co-PET). Ten different PP/co-PET/glass beads ternary composites were prepared, characterized and compared with the homologous PP/glass beads binary ones. Maleic anhydride-grafted PP was added as a compatibilizing agent for PP and co-PET in some of the studied formulations, and its effect studied. Furthermore, four different silane-treated glass beads were used to prepare the composites (50~wt.\%). Results showed that three different interfaces, corresponding to three different levels (low, middle and high) of particle/matrix adhesion, could be obtained in these composites by varying the matrix composition and the silane coupling agent on the glass bead surface, which resulted in a wide range of tensile properties, from ductile composites with low tensile strength and high elongation to brittle ones with high tensile strength. It was found that co-PET embeds glass bead surface independently of the silane coupling agent employed. Finally, the adhesion degree differences between the different composite phases seemed to be the main cause to explain the differences found in the sensitivity of the composite tensile characteristics to the strain rate.},

In this study, low-density polyethylene (LDPE) was compounded with different contents of poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) at 10\textendash 50 wt.\%, to evaluate the potential of replacing commercial plastics with a biodegradable renewable polymer, PBS for packaging applications. The morphological, mechanical and thermal properties of the LDPE/PBS blends were examined in relation to the effect of polyethylene\textendash graft\textendash maleic anhydride (PE\textendash g\textendash MA) as a compatibilizer. LDPE/PBS/PE\textendash g\textendash MA blends were fabricated via the melt blending method using an internal mixer and then were compression molded into test samples. The presence of LDPE, PBS and PE\textendash g\textendash MA individually in the matrix for each blend presented physical interaction between the constituents, as shown by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The morphology of LDPE/PBS/PE\textendash g\textendash MA blends showed improved compatibility and homogeneity between the LDPE matrix and PBS phase. Compatibilized LDPE/PBS blends showed an improvement in the tensile strength, with 5 phr of compatibilizer providing the optimal content. The thermal stability of LDPE/PBS blends decreased with higher PBS content and the thermal stability of compatibilized blends was higher in contrast to the uncompatibilized blends. Therefore, our research demonstrated that the partial substitution of LDPE with a biodegradable PBS and the incorporation of the PE\textendash g\textendash MA compatibilizer could develop an innovative blend with improved structural, mechanical and thermal properties.},

  abstract = {Background Anesthesia providers are at risk for contracting COVID-19 due to close patient contact, especially during shortages of personal protective equipment. We present an easy to follow and detailed protocol for producing 3D printed face shields and an effective decontamination protocol, allowing their reuse. Methods The University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) produced face shields using a combination of 3D printing and assembly with commonly available products, and produced a simple decontamination protocol to allow their reuse. To evaluate the effectiveness of the decontamination protocol, we inoculated bacterial suspensions of E. coli and S. aureus on to the face shield components, performed the decontamination procedure, and finally swabbed and enumerated organisms onto plates that were incubated for 12-24 hours. Decontamination effectiveness was evaluated using the average log10 reduction in colony counts. Results Approximately 112 face shields were constructed and made available for use in 72 hours. These methods were successfully implemented for in-house production at UNMC and at Tripler Army Medical Center (Honolulu, Hawaii). Overall, the decontamination protocol was highly effective against both E. coli and S. aureus, achieving a {$\geq$}4 log10 (99.99\%) reduction in colony counts for every replicate from each component of the face shield unit. Discussion Face shields not only act as a barrier against the soiling of N95 face masks, they also serve as more effective eye protection from respiratory droplets over standard eye shields. Implementation of decontamination protocols successfully allowed face shield and N95 mask reuse, offering a higher level of protection for anesthesiology providers at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions In a time of urgent need, our protocol enabled the rapid production of face shields by individuals with little to no 3D printing experience, and provided a simple and effective decontamination protocol allowing reuse of the face shields.},

  abstract = {The advances in additive manufacturing (AM) help the recycling, redesign, and reuse of waste plastics, enabling circular economy supply chains and business ecosystems. Distributed Recycling through Additive Manufacturing (DRAM) is a technique for recycling waste plastics using mechanical processes for AM. Even though these integrated concepts enable a new path to recycle waste plastics, there are numerous barriers to their implementation, especially in developing economies. The ten barriers to implementing DRAM for waste plastic recycling were finalized through the use of a literature review and the Delphi technique. To determine the contextual relationship between the barriers, the Interpretative Structural Modeling (ISM) technique was used. A case study was carried out to investigate the barriers to implementing AM in plastic waste management in a developing economy. The interrelationship among barriers was investigated and barrier prioritization was performed. The findings from the case study reveal that the lack of flexibility to implement circular economy (CE) goals is one of the main barriers to implementing AM in plastic waste management. Findings from this study provide insights for industry practitioners and policymakers in developing a strategy to implement AM in plastic waste management.},

  abstract = {Fabrication of three-dimensional structures has gained increasing importance in the bone tissue engineering (BTE) field. Mechanical properties and permeability are two important requirement for BTE scaffolds. The mechanical properties of the scaffolds are highly dependent on the processing parameters. Layer thickness, delay time between spreading each powder layer, and printing orientation are the major factors that determine the porosity and compression strength of the 3D printed scaffold. In this study, the aggregated artificial neural network (AANN) was used to investigate the simultaneous effects of layer thickness, delay time between spreading each layer, and print orientation of porous structures on the compressive strength and porosity of scaffolds. Two optimization methods were applied to obtain the optimal 3D parameter settings for printing tiny porous structures as a real BTE problem. First, particle swarm optimization algorithm was implemented to obtain the optimum topology of the AANN. Then, Pareto front optimization was used to determine the optimal setting parameters for the fabrication of the scaffolds with required compressive strength and porosity. The results indicate the acceptable potential of the evolutionary strategies for the controlling and optimization of the 3DP process as a complicated engineering problem.},

  abstract = {Metamaterials exhibit properties beyond those exhibited by conventional materials in conventional scenarios. These have been investigated both theoretically and experimentally at length. In many cases the underpinning physical understanding of metamaterials has greatly preceded our ability to manufacture constituent structures. However, the development of additive manufacturing techniques gives new possibilities for the fabrication of complex metamaterial structures, many of which cannot be realised through conventional fabrication methods. The literature to date contains contributions from a diverse group of researchers from the physical sciences, mathematics, and manufacturing technology in the creation of metamaterials for electromagnetic, acoustic and mechanical applications. It is proposed that additive manufacturing holds the key to realise the capabilities of this vibrant research community and permit the creation of new paradigms in fundamental structures but also exploitation through application. For this purpose, a literature review is presented which identifies key advances in metamaterials alongside additive manufacturing and proposes new opportunities for researchers to work together through intra/inter disciplinary research to realise structures which exhibit extraordinary behaviour(s). This review represents a comprehensive account of the state-of-the-art in the production of such metamaterials using additive manufacturing methods and highlights areas, which, based on trends observed in the literature, are worthy of further research and require a coordinated effort on behalf of the afore mentioned disciplines in order to advance the state-of-the-art.},

In view of the blend morphology, the presence of PP-g-HI reduced the particle size of the dispersed phase by the reduced interfacial tension between the PP and PET phases, indicating the in situ copolymer (PP-g-PET) generated during the melt blending. The DSC thermograms for the cooling run indicated that the PET crystallization in the PP-g-HI rich phase was affected by the chemical reactions of PET and PP-g-HI. The improved mechanical properties for the PET/PP-g-HI blends were shown in the measurement of the tensile and flexural properties. In addition, the water absorption test indicated that the PET/PP-g-HI blend was more effective than the PET/PP blend in improving the water resistance of PET. The positive properties of PET/PP-g-HI blends stemmed from the improved compatibilization of the PET/PP blend. \textcopyright{} 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

  abstract = {Purpose \textendash{} A low-cost, open source, self-replicating rapid prototyper (RepRap) has been developed, which greatly expands the potential user base of rapid prototypers. The operating cost of the RepRap can be further reduced using waste polymers as feedstock. Centralized recycling of polymers is often uneconomic and energy intensive due to transportation embodied energy. The purpose of this paper is to provide a proof of concept for high-value recycling of waste polymers at distributed creation sites. Design/methodology/approach \textendash{} Previous designs of waste plastic extruders (also known as RecycleBots) were evaluated using a weighted evaluation matrix. An updated design was completed and the description and analysis of the design is presented including component summary, testing procedures, a basic life cycle analysis and extrusion results. The filament was tested for consistency of density and diameter while quantifying electricity consumption. Findings \textendash{} Filament was successfully extruded at an average rate of 90 mm/min and used to print parts. The filament averaged 2.805 mm diameter with 87 per cent of samples between 2.540 mm and 3.081 mm. The average mass was 0.564 g/100 mm length. Energy use was 0.06 kWh/m. Practical implications \textendash{} The success of the RecycleBot further reduces RepRap operating costs, which enables distributed in-home, value added, plastic recycling. This has implications for municipal waste management programs, as in-home recycling could reduce cost and greenhouse gas emissions associated with waste collection and transportation, as well as the environmental impact of manufacturing custom plastic parts. Originality/value \textendash{} This paper reports on the first technical evaluation of a feedstock filament for the RepRap from waste plastic material made in a distributed recycling device.},

Linear economy (take, make, throw) recycles as little as 2 \% of plastics globally, wasting the humongous amount of resources. This is high time for the implementation of the circular economy, especially among plastics. A circular economy would both maximize the merits of plastics and minimize their ill effects, through such actions as producing them from plants rather than fossil fuels; redesigning products to cut waste and make them last; boosting recycling and reuse, and utilizing plastic wastes as a resource; to name a few. Categorizing the post-industrial plastic waste can lead to differentiating recyclables, reusable from dead-end plastics. This will help us to reduce what we don't need and reuse what we need. In this study, we are focusing on the plastic waste generated by packaging industry because they contribute the highest (almost 40\%) of total plastic waste generated. A model for recycling the waste generated from packaging industry has been proposed which provides recycling of the waste in multiple levels i.e. we can extract the same product from the waste by high grade recycling of can use them in secondary operations like as charcoal, construction material. After that an AHP analysis has been prepared for identifying best plastic waste collection methods because for successful operation of recycling to happen, collection and proper segregation is a very important prerequisite. Results showed that Deposit and Refund method collection is best suited for waste collection method as it is supporting the concept of circular economy. At the end, a case study of successful implementation of Circular Economy is presented.},

The life-cycle assessment (LCA) methodology is used to assess the potential environmental impacts of recycling postconsumer PET and HDPE. It quantifies the total energy requirements, energy sources, atmospheric pollutants, waterborne pollutants, and solid waste resulting from the production of recycled PET and HDPE resin from the postconsumer plastic. System expansion and cut-off recycling allocation methods are applied. The analysis has been carried out according to the LCA standard, series UNI EN ISO 14040-14044:2006. A standard unit of output (functional unit) is defined as ``one ton of PET flake'' and ``one ton of HDPE pellet.'' The results of the production of virgin resin are compared with the ``cut-off'' and ``system expansion'' recycling results. Depending on the allocation methods applied, a nonrenewable energy saving of 40\textendash 85\% and greenhouse gas emission saving of 25\textendash 75\% can be achieved. Based on two allocation methods, PET and HDPE recycling offers important environmental benefits over single-use virgin PET and HDPE. LCA offers a powerful tool for assisting companies and policy-makers in the waste plastic industry. Furthermore, the ``system expansion'' recycling method is not easy to apply because it requires detailed data outside of the life cycle of the investigated product.},

Grafting reactions of maleic anhydride and ST onto PP were conducted according to an experimental design where the concentrations of maleic anhydride and ST were varied. The amount of reacted maleic anhydride and the extent of degradation in PP were determined by means of Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy and melt-flow index, respectively. The PET/EP copolymer blends were obtained in a co-rotating twin-screw extruder. The effect of grafted copolymer type, PP-g-MA (PP grafted with maleic anhydride) or PP-g-MAST (PP grafted with maleic anhydride and styrene) in the compatibilization of PET/EP copolymer blends was assessed through mechanical (tensile test), morphological (scanning electron microscopy), and rheological properties. The presence of ST in the grafting reaction of maleic anhydride onto PP showed to significantly increase the amount of reacted maleic anhydride and reduce PP degradation. However, increasing ST concentration in the reaction mass affected the investigated variables only when maleic anhydride concentration was at its lowest level. Results of the PET/EP blends showed that both graft copolymers improved polymer interface adhesion, however, PP-g-MAST showed improved performance for the same level of compatibilizer used. \textcopyright{} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {Previous studies have shown that 3D printed composites exhibit an orthotropic nature with inherently lower interlayer mechanical properties. This research work is an attempt to improve the interlayer tensile strength of extrusion-based 3D printed composites. Annealing was identified as a suitable post-processing method and was the focus of this study. Two distinct thermoplastic polymers, which are common in 3D printing, were selected to study the enhancement of interlayer tensile strength of composites by additive manufacturing: a) an amorphous polyethylene terephthalate-glycol (PETG), and b) a semi-crystalline poly (lactic acid) (PLA). It was determined that short carbon fiber reinforced composites have lower interlayer tensile strength than the corresponding neat polymers in 3D printed parts. This reduction in mechanical performance was attributable to an increase in melt viscosity and the consequential slower interlayer diffusion bonding. However, the reduction in interlayer tensile strength could be recovered by post-processing when the annealing temperature was higher than the glass transition temperature of the amorphous polymer. In the case of the semi-crystalline polymer, the recovery of the interlayer tensile strength was only observed when the annealing temperature was higher than the glass transition temperature but lower than the cold-crystallization temperature. This study utilized rheological and thermal analysis of 3D printed composites to provide a better understanding of the interlayer strength response and, therefore, overcome a mechanical performance limitation of these materials.},

This paradigm shift in composite processing technology is primarily driven by out-of-autoclave tooling applications, in which fiber reinforced composite molds with scaledup sizes and embedded heating elements are attractive. The present research describes the design, manufacturing, and testing of self-heating composite molds fabricated via a large-scale pellet extrusion 3D printing machine with an integrated wire co-extrusion tool. Polycarbonate (PC) composites reinforced with carbon fiber (PC/CF; 20 wt.\%) and glass fiber (PC/GF; 20 wt.\%) were used to fabricate mold parts. Joule heating thermal test results showed that uniform temperatures (\textasciitilde 100 {$\smwhtcircle$}C) were achieved for both PC/CF and PC/GF mold surfaces, using a custom-made feedback control power supply and infrared thermography. Mechanical charac\- terizations, including tensile and flexural testing were performed on the wire-embedded and un-wired PC/CF and PC/GF base specimens to investigate the impact of the fiber reinforcement as well as the embedded wires. In the direction of extrusion, the ultimate tensile stress of PC/CF was 105 MPa, and that of PC/GF was 73 MPa, while the neat PC value was 64 MPa. Inner-bead voids and interfacial gaps were observed and characterized via optical and scanning electron microscopy. The embedded wires and inner bead impacted the mechanical properties of the composites. However, the stiffness of the wire-embedded mold was still satisfactory, proving that the technology can be used to fabricate additively manufactured out-of-oven/autoclave molds.},

The technique allows for complex shapes to be made with a degree of design freedom unachievable with traditional manufacturing methods. However, the mechanical properties of the thermoplastic materials used are low compared to common engineering materials. In this work, composite 3D printing feedstocks for FFF are investigated, wherein carbon fibres are embedded into a thermoplastic matrix to increase strength and stiffness. First, the key processing parameters for FFF are reviewed, showing how fibres alter the printing dynamics by changing the viscosity and the thermal profile of the printed material. The state-of-the-art in composite 3D printing is presented, showing a distinction between short fibre feedstocks versus continuous fibre feedstocks. An experimental study was performed to benchmark these two methods. It is found that printing of continuous carbon fibres using the MarkOne printer gives significant increases in performance over unreinforced thermoplastics, with mechanical properties in the same order of magnitude of typical unidirectional epoxy matrix composites. The method, however, is limited in design freedom as the brittle continuous carbon fibres cannot be deposited freely through small steering radii and sharp angles. Filaments with embedded short carbon microfibres ({$\sim$}100\,{$\mu$}m) show better print capabilities and are suitable for use with standard printing methods, but only offer a slight increase in mechanical properties over the pure thermoplastic properties. It is hypothesized that increasing the fibre length in short fibre filament is expected to lead to increased mechanical properties, potentially approaching those of continuous fibre composites, whilst keeping the high degree of design freedom of the FFF process.},

The functionalized products were analyzed by FTIR and titulometry. Functionalization reactions were performed with high density polyethylene. The maximum incorporation of maleic anhydride achieved was 0,48\%. In the second stage, ternary blends of HDPE (60 or 65\%), funcionalized HDPE (HDPE-AM) (5 or10\%) and poly(ethylene terephthalate) (30\%), were performed in the Haake mixer. The morphology of the blends was evaluated by DSC and SEM and these analysis showed the formation of heterogeneous blends with the small degree of compatibilization when compared to the blend without HDPE-AM The properties were evaluated by strain curves and impact strength. These properties were inferior when compared to the original polymers but with improvement when compared with the binary blend. It will be produced plates made of blends to be used in civil construction. The aim of the project is teh development of biodegradable products with elastomeric characteristics.}

  abstract = {The effects of the addition of different functionalized compatibilizers on toughness, morphology and rheological properties of a polypropylene (PP) \textendash{} poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) (85\textendash 15 wt\%) blend were studied. The three compatibilizers compared were: (Styrene Ethylene Butylene Styrene)-grafted-(glycidyl methacrylate); (Styrene Ethylene Butylene Styrene) \textendash{} grafted \textendash{} (maleic anhydryde); (polyolefin) \textendash{} grafted \textendash{} (glycidyl methacrylate), abbreviated to: SEBS-g-GMA, SEBS-g-MA and POE-g-GMA respectively. The effective grafting content was the same for all three compatibilizers. Before the comparison of the different compatibilizers was done, first the effects of three different processing temperatures and three different compatibilizer contents were investigated, based on the addition of SEBS-g-GMA. The compatibilization effect was significantly improved with an increase in processing temperature from 250 to 300 \textdegree C. The toughness was increased with almost a factor two and a decrease in the average domain size of the dispersed phase was observed. An increase in compatibilizer content from 0.25 to 2.5 wt\% resulted in a finer dispersity as well as in a steep increase in toughness, which was noted to approach the brittle-to-ductile transition. The comparison of the three compatibilizers was subsequently done at the most promising processing temperature and content: 300 \textdegree C and 2.5 wt\%. The results showed that the addition of SEBS-g-MA and POE-g-GMA had a less significant positive effect on the compatibilization compared to SEBS-g-GMA. The difference is attributed to a higher reactivity for GMA compared to MA and a higher possibility for migration towards the PP-PET interface for the SEBS chain compared to the POE chain.},

The proposed method involves an individual approach to evaluating the competitiveness of each innovation project, because each innovative project is unique, the same as the set affecting its competitiveness factors. To more objectively assess the competitiveness of individual innovation projects in the forestry sector, it is proposed to use "points of support". The "points of support" of the innovative project are the circumstances that have developed at this point in time (at this stage in the life cycle of the project), due to which the chances for successful development of the analyzed innovation project are increased. Use of this technique to assess the competitiveness of innovative projects implemented in other areas is possible, but only in case of making appropriate adjustments (it is possible to change the "fundamental modules" or the quantitative range of "points of support").},

  abstract = {The rise of antibiotic resistant bacterial species is driving the requirement for medical devices that minimise infection risks. Antimicrobial functionality may be achieved by modifying the implant design to incorporate a reservoir that locally releases a therapeutic. For this approach to be successful it is critical that mechanical functionality of the implant is maintained. This study explores the opportunity to exploit the design flexibilities possible using additive manufacturing to develop porous lattices that maximise the volume available for drug loading while maintaining load-bearing capacity of a hip implant. Eight unit cell types were initially investigated and a volume fraction of 30\% was identified as the lowest level at which all lattices met the design criteria in ISO 13314. Finite element analysis (FEA) identified three lattice types that exhibited significantly lower displacement (10-fold) compared with other designs; Schwartz primitive, Schwartz primitive pinched and cylinder grid. These lattices were additively manufactured in Ti-6Al-4V using selective laser melting. Each design exceeded the minimum strength requirements for orthopaedic hip implants according to ISO 7206-4. The Schwartz primitive (Pinched) lattice geometry, with 10\% volume fill and a cubic unit cell period of 10, allowed the greatest void volume of all lattice designs whilst meeting the fatigue requirements for use in an orthopaedic implant (ISO 7206-4). This paper demonstrates an example of how additive manufacture may be exploited to add additional functionality to medical implants.},

  abstract = {Due to its low cost and easy use, the use of material extrusion (MEX) as an additive manufacturing (AM) technology has increased rapidly in recent years. However, this process mainly involves the processing of new plastics. Combining the MEX process with polyethylene terephthalate (PET), which offers a high potential for mechanical and chemical recyclability, opens up a broad spectrum of reutilization possibilities. Turning used PET bottles into printable filament for MEX is not only a recycling option, but also an attractive upcycling scenario that can lead to the production of complex, functional parts. This work analyzes the process of extruding recycled PET bottle flakes into a filament, taking different extrusion screws and extrusion parameters into account. The filament is subsequently processed with MEX into tensile tests. An accompanying thermal, rheological and mechanical characterization of the recycled resin is performed to offer a comparison to the virgin material and a commercially available glycol modified polyethylene terephthalate (PETG) filament. The results show the importance of adequate drying parameters prior to the extrusion and the sensitivity of the material to moisture, leading to degradation. The recycled material is more prone to degradation and presents lower viscosities. Mechanical tests display a higher tensile strength of the recycled and virgin resin in comparison to the PETG. The extrusion of the used PET into a filament and the subsequent printing with the MEX process offers a viable recycling process for the discarded material.},

  abstract = {Distributed recycling via additive manufacturing (DRAM) emphasizes an emerging approach to locally recycle waste plastic by 3D-printing it into valuable products. Although major progress has been reported in the last decade to validate the technical feasibility, and economic viability of the DRAM as an unitary operation, the environmental evaluation of this approach is still at its early stage as a distributed recycling network. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the environmental impact of a DRAM unit as a baseline scenario, compared to two scenarios of the virgin supply chain plastic filament used in the printing process. To achieve this goal, a comparative environmental performance using a life cycle assessment (LCA) is performed to estimate the multidimensional potential impacts of virgin and recycled polylactic acid (PLA). The study takes place using a physical recycling demonstrator developed at a university in Nancy, France. Four impact categories were considered: climate change, potential eutrophication (Freshwater and Marine), resource depletion (Fossil and Water), and ion radiation. For the first three impact categories, the results demonstrate a minimum 97\% reduction in environmental impact compared to a virgin supply chain. However, in terms of ion radiation, the amount of emissions is approximately 2.8 times higher than that of the virgin plastic scenario. This increase is mainly due to the specific situation in France, where most of the energy is generated using nuclear means. This study aims to expand on the environmental assessment of the plastic recycling network system to better understand the implementation of these systems for waste plastic management, which can help extend the lifetime of plastic material. The findings provide an environmental overview of the benefits and disadvantages of developing a DRAM system in a particular context.},

Some specific characteristics are required for the components designed for peculiar applications, such as complex geometries, lightweight, and high strength as well as breathability and aesthetic appearance specifically in the biomedical field. All these design specifications could be potentially satisfied by manufacturing with 3D printing techniques. Moreover, the development of purpose-dedicated filaments can be considered a key factor to successfully meet all the requirements. In this paper, fabrication and applications of five new thermoplastic materials with fillers are described and analyzed. They are organic bio-plastic compounds made of polylactic acid (PLA) and organic by-products. The growing interest in these new composite materials reinforced with organic by-products is due to the reduction of production management costs and their low environmental impact. In this study, the production workflow has been set up and described in detail. The main properties of these new thermoplastic materials have been analyzed with a major emphasis on strength, lightweight, and surface finish. The analysis showed that these materials can be particularly suitable for biomedical applications. Therefore, two different biomedical devices were selected and relative prototypes were manufactured with one of the analyzed thermoplastic materials. The feasibility, benefits, and performance of the thermoplastic material considered for these applications were successfully assessed.},

  abstract = {Unprecedented levels of production and consumption has led to solid waste accumulation in landfills and oceans. Two significant landfill constituents are textile waste and discarded plastic bottles. Since there is a finite amount of space available for landfill use, solutions that reuse these post-consumer products are imperative. The work presented here is a methodology for producing natural fiber-reinforced polymer composites (NFRPCs) from pseudo-raw materials. Post-consumer textile waste and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) water bottles were made compatible by way of surface modifications. Melt compounding was used to form a monofilament feedstock for extrusion-based 3D printing platforms. Hydrolysis and functionalization of cellulose fibers from white denim cloth was performed. It was found that adding recycled textile fibers to the recycled PET matrix had a toughening effect. Materials characterization involving dynamic mechanical analysis, attenuated total reflectance, impact testing, melt flow index, and scanning electron microscopy were carried out to verify the efficacy of the functionalization process and to ascertain the robustness of the filler/matrix interface. The outcome is a demonstration of a feasible method for the repurposing of waste products for 3D printing applications.},

Waste collection is a complex process that requires the use of large amount of money and an elaborate management of logistics. In this paper an approch to smart waste collection is proposed able to improve and optimize the handling of solid urban waste. Context of smart waste management requires interconnection among heterogeneous devices and data sharing involving a large amount of people. Smart-M3 platform solves these problems offering a high degree of decoupling and scalability.Waste collection is made by real-time monitoring the level of bin's fullness through sensors placed inside the containers. This method enables to exempt from collecting semi-empty bins. Furthermore, incoming data can be provided to decisional algorithms in order to determine the optimal number of waste vehicles or bins to distribute in the territory. The presented solution gives important advantages for both service providers and consumers. The formers could obtain a sensible cost reduction. On the other hand, users may benefit from a higher level of service quality. In order to make users feel closer to their community, they can interact with the system to be aware about the fulness state of the nearest bins. Finally, a mechanism for collecting ``green points'' was introduced for encouraging citizens to recycle.},

These were incorporated into PP blends (with either 70 or 90 wt\% PET), replacing 1/5 of PP in the system. The use of these modifiers changed the blends' tensile mechanical behavior from fragile to ductile. Blend tensile strength was improved by 10\% and elongation at break showed 10 to 20-fold increases while stiffness remained constant. Scanning electron micrographs showed the PP average domain size in injection molded specimens to decrease to the micron/sub-micron size upon addition of the GMA modified resins, while the unmodified blends exhibited heterogeneous morphology comprising large lamellae 10\textendash 20 {$\mu$}m wide. The low-GMA graft content PP seemed slightly more efficient than the high GMA content PP in emulsifiying PP/PET blends. The GMA grafting level on PP had very limited effects on the blends' mechanical behavior in the range of GMA graft density provided by the two modified resins investigated.},

  abstract = {FTIR spectroscopic technique is projected in the present work to make complete qualitative analysis on high density polyethylene (HDPE) and commercial HDPE polymers. Infrared spectra have been used for the molecular structure study of the repeating unit of polyethylene. The qualitative analysis of the commercial HDPE samples has been made by evaluating the internal standards with the standard source sample as the reference. The internal standards are ratios indicative of the quality of the sample. The internal standards are computed for certain specific modes of vibration and are compared to identify the quality and purity of the samples. Thus, FTIR spectral measurements have been made to differentiate the commercial HDPE samples with the source HDPE. The growth of polyethylene products has acquired enormous heights owing to its application as insulating material. The dielectric constants have been determined for all polymer samples in the GHz range using the microwave benches. The magnitude of dielectric constants for all samples observed in X band is of the same trend as that in K band, i.e. a decrease in dielectric constant with increase in microwave frequency has been observed. Materials with lower dielectric constant would be preferred for insulation application due to their high dielectric strength.},

  abstract = {Semi-crystalline polymers are an important class of materials for engineering applications due to their high modulus and barrier properties. Traditional manufacturing methods process semi-crystalline polymers via rigid molds and well-controlled temperature and pressure environments to handle the significant change in specific volume occurring during crystallization; however, material extrusion additive manufacturing does not use these features. This often leads to warpage-induced build failure in fused filament fabrication (FFF). To enable FFF of semi-crystalline polymers, this work investigates characteristics of immiscible polymer blends (e.g., disparate crystallization behavior and phase separation) to mitigate warping failure during printing. A series of poly(ethylene terephthalate)/polypropylene/polypropylene\textendash graft\textendash maleic anhydride blends are explored and the effect of thermal and morphological characteristics on printability is analyzed. It is shown that these blends can be extruded into filament and printed into a 3D structure. Extrapolations indicate that phase-separated blends with increased total crystallization half-time are beneficial for FFF printing.},

This study estimates the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy consumption of these supply chains, including transportation and end-of-life processes, lacking in prior studies. We calculate annual GHG emissions and energy consumption of these plastic supply chains to be 101 MMT CO2-eq and 3248 PJ in 2019, respectively. The GHG emissions of these supply chains represented 1.5\% of the total U.S. emissions and 5\% of the total U.S. industry-related GHG emissions. The total energy consumption of these supply chains represented 3.1\% of the total U.S. energy consumption in 2019. Transportation of PET and polyolefin plastic materials contributes 5\% and 2\% to the total supply chain GHG emissions and energy consumption, respectively.

To improve the properties of the blends, ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA) was used as a compatibilizer. Based on torque rheometer tests, the higher the concentration of PET in the blends, the higher the initial loading torque. Blends of 50\% HDPE and 50\% PET had the lowest equilibrium torque. Equilibrium torque was highest at 5\% EVA. The presence of EVA made only a slight difference in the glass transition temperatures of HDPE/PET blends. Higher EVA content in the blend resulted in a lower melting endotherm. Thermogravimetric analysis showed that thermal stability was independent of EVA content; but the more PET in the blend, the lower the final weight loss.},

Three AFOs were manufactured, one by the conventional approach using polypropylene (PP) and the other two by FDM using polycarbonate-acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (PC-ABS) and ULTEM materials. Experimental studies were performed to quantify the loading condition on the AFO by measuring the strain during a subject's walking gait. A finite element model was developed to inversely calculate both the static and dynamic loading during the gait cycle and predict distributions of stress and strain as well as the rotational stiffness, an indicator of rigidity and biomechanical function of an AFO. This study uses AFO as an example to present a methodology for design and fabrication of orthoses with desired properties and functionality based on additive manufacturing approach.

The market for development of advanced biocomposite materials produced from biomass and recyclable post-consumer plastics is increasing. Natural fibre-reinforced biocomposites based on rice husk biofibre (RHB), recycled high-density polyethylene (rHDPE) and recycled polyethylene terephthalate (rPET) were prepared through a two-step extrusion and hot pressing.

Maleic anhydride polyethylene (MAPE) was added as a coupling agent to enhance the interfacial adhesion of the fibre-matrix phases. Results showed that water absorption, thickness swelling (TS) and tensile and flexural properties enhanced tremendously with the increase of rice husk filler loadings. Biocomposites based on compatibilized blend matrix exhibited higher mechanical properties and dimensional stability than those based on uncompatibilized ones. Thermal analysis results from thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) indicated the notable improvement in thermal stability as the added rice husk (RH) fibre content increased.

  abstract = {The use of natural fibers and nano-sized fillers to reinforce polymers has been tremendously exploited, however, the properties enhancements imparted by a single type of fillers is still in the unsatisfactory level. This research work was aimed to fabricate a novel bionanocomposites using hybrid reinforcements of natural fibers and nanofillers to promote their synergy effects in comprehensive improvements in the recycled polymeric matrix along with maintaining environmental appeal. The compatibilizing effect in organoclay reinforced recycled HDPE/PET blend and its rice husk (RH) incorporated nanocomposite with polyethylene-grafted maleic anhydride (PE-g-MA) or/and ethylene-glycidyl methacrylate (E-GMA) was evaluated. The increase in mechanical properties of compatibilized blend and RH nanocomposite achieved up to 40\% and 34\%, respectively. Another high improvement of flame-retarding effect was reported where the burning rate was reduced by 29e37\% via compatibilization of blend matrix. These effects were evidence for the enhanced matrix-filler interfacial bonding and relative intercalation of clay in matrix. The schematic modeling for the components interaction in the bio-nanocomposite system has postulated. It can be concluded that clay/recycled polymer blend with hybrid compatibilizers was appeared to be the most effective matrix in the manufacture of RH-nanocomposites. The development of bio nanocomposites using RH as new material source in this work is greener and high-end performance to replace the limited wood as decking applications.},

  abstract = {Green composite materials were made from agricultural and plastic wastes which were rice husk (RH), recycled high-density polyethylene (rHDPE), and recycled polyethylene terephthalate (rPET), by twin-screw extrusion and hot/cold pressing molding. The dimensional stability, orthotropic swelling, and mechanical performance of the green composites were determined as a function of bio-filler concentration for neat (uncompatibilized) and compatbilized rHDPE/rPET blend based composites. Water absorption and swelling results showed a linear increase with the RH concentration. The highest swelling occurred in the thickness of the composites, followed by the width and length, respectively. Water absorption and dimensional instability of compatibilized recycled polymer blend (rPB)-based composites were lower than those of neat rPB-based composites. As RH concentration increased, the flexural properties increased significantly. The optimum tensile strength and modulus were achieved at 70 wt\% RH. It is interesting to note that compatibilization of polymer blend matrix had further increased the strength and elongation properties of composites. POLYM.

Ellipsoid-shaped gastric floating tablets with low infill percentage of 15\% and 25\% (namely E-15 and E-25) were then prepared respectively by feeding the extruded filaments to FDM 3D printer. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were employed to characterize the filaments and 3D-printed tablets, and a series of evaluations were performed to the 3D-printed tablets, including the weight variation, drug content, hardness, in vitro floating behavior, and drug release of the tablets. The SEM results showed that the drug-loaded filaments and 3D-printed tablets appeared intact without defects, and the printed tablets were composed of filaments deposited uniformly layer by layer. The model drug and the excipients were thermally stable under the process temperature of extruding and printing, with a small amount of drug crystals dispersing in the drug-loaded filaments and 3D-printed tablets. Both E-15 and E-25 could float on artificial gastric fluids without any lag time and released in a sustained manner. Compared with E-15, the E-25 presented less weight variation, higher tablet hardness, shorter floating time, and longer drug release time.},

The water absorption (WA) upon immersion in sea water, mechanical behavior, and combustion enthalpy of green composites were examined. The WA mechanisms obeyed the Fickian diffusion. The computed diffusion coefficient (D), thermodynamic solubility (S), permeability (P), and orthotropic swelling were generally increased as a function of RH filler. The increment of tensile strength and modulus of composites were maximized up to 16\% and 121\%, respectively, which was achieved at 70 wt\% RH filler. The theoretical prediction of tensile strength and Young?s modulus from micromechanical models for random oriented RH fiber/blend composites were compared with the experimental results. As the RH weight fraction increased, the combustion enthalpy decreased (by approximately 30?48\%) and thereby the enhancing the fire retardancy of green composite.},

Here we give an account of a facile approach for the bulk production of a polyethylene terephthalate (PET)/polypropylene (PP)-based nanocomposite blend with Inorganic Fullerene Tungsten Sulfide (IF-WS2) nanofiller using a single extruder. Nanofiller IF-WS2 was produced by the rotary chemical vapor deposition (RCVD) method. Subsequently, IF-WS2 nanoparticles were dispersed in PET and PP in different loadings to access impact and their dispersion behavior in polymer matrices. As-prepared blend nanocomposites were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), dynamic differential scanning (DSC), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). In this work, the tensile strength of the PP/PET matrix with 1\% IF-WS2 increased by 31.8\%, and the thermal stability of the sample PP/PET matrix with 2\% increased by 18 \textdegree C. There was an extraordinary decrease in weight loss at elevated temperature for the nanocomposites in TGA analysis, which confirms the role of IF-WS2 on thermal stability versus plain nanocomposites. In addition, this method can also be used for the large-scale production of such materials used in high-temperature environments.},

  abstract = {4D printing, as a booming additive manufacturing technology of smart material, provides a new opportunity for the development of shape memory polymers (SMPs). Meanwhile, the diversity of SMPs structure calls for flexible and well-adapted printing technology. Fused deposition modelling (FDM) is one of the most versatile and cost-effective methods owing to the simplicity of the technique and broad compatibility with a wide variety of materials, but it fails to deal with the fabrication of shape memory networks that possess excellent structural stability as well as shape memory effect (SME). Aiming to personalized or patient-adaptable treatment devices, in this work, we demonstrate a UV-assisted FDM 4D printing strategy to fabricate elbow protector models based on shape memory copolyester networks. First, the linear unsaturated copolyesters were synthesized, amongst, poly(lactic acid) was chosen as hard segment providing the material a good mechanical performance and printability, the poly({$\epsilon$}-caprolactone) with strong crystallizability was employed as switching segment, and a functional coupling agent contained double bonds was used to join the two segments and as the same time. This copolyester can be easily processed into filament, and the in-situ formation of photo-crosslinking network during the UV-assisted FDM printing not only enhances the bonding strength of each layer, but also may guarantee the obtained objects a good shape memory property. Three models with distinctly Chinese characteristics were printed to demonstrate excellent SME. Then, the elbow protectors both in personalized and patient-adaptable treatment strategies were developed, which indicates a great potential in robust applications.},

At 10\% PET loading, E-43 has the opposite effect of slightly reducing the tensile properties. All the blends are more brittle relative to either plain PET or PP. The addition of E-43 results in negligible improvement in the elongation at break. E-43 is also found to be an effective lubricant in improving the processability of the blends.

The olefinic segment of POE is compatible with PP, whereas the maleic anhydride is affined with PET carbonyl groups. The effectiveness of the compatibilizing agent was evaluated using different techniques, such as Fourier transform IR spectroscopy, mechanical analysis, scanning electron microscopy, dynamic mechanical analysis, and rheological analysis. The results show that the addition of POE-g-MA promotes a fine dispersed-phase morphology, and improves process ability and toughness of these blends.

  abstract = {3D printing has received lots of attention due to its limitless potential and advantages in comparison to traditional manufacturing processes. This study focuses on the most popular type of home 3D printers, namely fused filament fabrication (FFF) printers, which use plastic filaments as the feedstock. The rather high material cost and large amount of plastic waste generated by FFF 3D printers have driven the need for plastic filaments produced from recycled plastic waste. This study evaluates, in terms of physical characterization, the feasibility of using recycled high-density polyethylene (HDPE), one of the most commonly used plastics, as the feedstock for 3D printers, in comparison with the common acrylonitrile butadiene styrene plastic pellets. In-house extrusion using recycled HDPE pellets and flakes is possible.

This work investigates the thermomechanical, physical, and biological properties of PLA-based composites fabricated using FDM. PLA-based bio-ceramics (Al2O3 and Yttria Stabilized Zirconia [YSZ]) filaments have been used to prepare tensile, compression, and flexural specimens. Scanning electron microscopy has been performed to reveal the fracture characteristics of the composite specimens. Besides this, the feasibility of the polymer composite for biomaterial applications has also been analyzed. The results show that PLA/Al2O3 has 30.44, 55.2, and 83.73 MPa tensile, compressive, and flexural strength, respectively. The present study also shows that the reinforcement of PLA with bioceramics also led to a reduction in wear and Coefficient Of Friction (COF) at varying loads.},

In this work, recycled polystyrene (rPS)/recycled polypropylene (rPP) blend was extruded into filament for FFF printing. The increase in printing temperature obviously reduced the air gaps and improved the interlayer adhesion. However, the printed specimen only exhibited optimum tensile strength at printing temperature of 230\textdegree C. The printed specimens with rPS/rPP at 80/20 blend ratio showed the lowest tensile strength due to poor printed layers adhesion caused by incompatibility of polymer blend. However, printed specimens with rPS/rPP at 50/50 blend ratio could achieve optimum strength of 32 MPa. The micrographs proved that the voids in printed specimen were smaller or absent when the printing temperature and rPP content in the blend was increased. This means that the increase in print temperature and rPP content displayed a positive effect on the printed specimens. The effect of blend ratio had significantly increased melt flow and crystallinity of rPS/rPP blend when the rPP content was increased in the blend. However, the increase of melt flow and crystallinity led to noticeable warpage on the printed specimen.},

  abstract = {The interlayer strengths of parts produced through material extrusion (also referred to as fused filament fabrication or FFF) suffer due to poor interlayer contact and insufficient diffusion. A model for predicting interlayer contact, based on pressure-driven flow, is combined with a model for polymer chain diffusion to predict the interlayer strength (aka, bond strength) of material extrusion parts. Interlayer contact is predicted based on in-line pressure measurements while diffusion is predicted based on in-line temperature and viscosity measurements, demonstrating that a combination of the appropriate in-line sensors and models can be used for real-time monitoring and process control. The interlayer strength model is successfully validated against strength measurements of parts made with high impact polystyrene, indicating that the strength of all parts suffers due to incomplete interlayer contact while only some parts suffered from incomplete diffusive healing. The melt pressure and in-line rheological measurements have proven extremely valuable for understanding the material extrusion process, optimizing quality, and monitoring consistency. Practical insights from the model are provided about how to select appropriate materials and processing conditions, and it concludes with a demonstration of using the in-line sensors and real-time modeling for defect detection.},

The findings reveal four supply chain archetypes, which demonstrate that 3D printing is impacting the humanitarian supply chain with respects to networks, governance, processes and products. We compare the benefits and challenges of these archetypes to contest that 3D printing will not necessarily simplify and shorten the supply chain. Instead, we suggest the need for a holistic supply chain approach that includes the local production of 3D printers and filament, alongside local design and manufacture. This much-needed study provides the foundations for future academic research and offers relevant guidance for practitioners using 3D printing in the humanitarian sector.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, the low recycling rate of polymers is still a challenge to humankind due to energy, economic and logistical issues. In the context of additive manufacturing, there is an exponential use of thermoplastic materials in the industrial and public open-source additive manufacturing sector, leading to an increase in global polymer consumption and waste generation. However, the coupling of the open-source 3D printers with polymer processing could potentially offer the basis for a new paradigm of distributed recycling process. It could be a complementary alternative to the traditional paradigm of centralized recycling of polymers, which is often uneconomical and energy intensive due to transportation embodied energy. In order to achieve this goal, a first step is to prove the technical feasibility to recycle thermoplastic material intended for open-source 3D printing feedstock. The contribution of the present study is twofold: first, a general methodology to evaluate the recyclability of thermoplastics used as feedstock in open-source 3D printing machines is proposed. Then, the proposed methodology is applied to the recycling study of polylactic acid (PLA) material addressed to the fused filament fabrication (FFF) technique, which is currently the most widely used. The main results of this application contribute to the understanding of the influence of the material's physico-chemical degradation on its mechanical properties as well as its potential distributed recyclability.},

This concept of Distributed Recycling via Additive Manufacturing (DRAM) is related to the use of recycled materials by means of mechanical recycling process in the 3D printing process chain. This paper aims to examine the current advances on thermoplastic recycling processes via additive manufacturing technologies. After proposing a closed recycling global chain for DRAM, a systematic literature review including 92 papers from 2009 to 2019 was performed using the scopus, web of science and springer databases. This work examines main topics from six stages (recovery, preparation, compounding, feedstock, printing, quality) of the proposed DRAM chain. The results suggested that few works have been done for the recovery and preparation stages, while a great progress has already been done for the other stages in order to validate the technical feasibility, environmental impact, and economic viability. Potential research paths in the pre-treatment of recycled material at local level and printing chain phases were identified in order to connect the development of DRAM with the circular economy ambition at micro, meso and macro level. The development of each stage proposed using the open source approach is a relevant path to scale DRAM to reach the full technical potential as a centerpiece of the circular economy.},

  abstract = {Recycling of plastics is urged by the need for closing material loops to maintain our natural resources when striving towards circular economy, but also by the concern raced by observations of plastic scrap in oceans and lakes. Packaging industry is the sector using the largest share of plastics, hence packaging dominates in the plastic waste flow. The aim of this paper was to sum up the recycling potential of post-consumer plastic packaging waste in Finland. This potential was evaluated based on the quantity, composition and mechanical quality of the plastic packaging waste generated by consumers and collected as a source-separated fraction, within the mixed municipal solid waste (MSW) or within energy waste. Based on the assessment 86,000\textendash 117,000 tons (18 kg/person/a) of post-consumer plastic packaging waste was generated in Finland in 2014. The majority, 84\% of the waste was in the mixed MSW flow in 2014. Due to the launching of new sorting facilities and separate collections for post-consumer plastic packaging in 2016, almost 40\% of the post-consumer plastic packaging could become available for recycling. However, a 50\% recycling rate for post-consumer plastic packaging (other than PET bottles) would be needed to increase the overall MSW recycling rate from the current 41\% by around two percentage points. The share of monotype plastics in the overall MSW plastics fraction was 80\%, hence by volume the recycling potential of MSW plastics is high. Polypropylene (PP) and low density polyethylene (LDPE) were the most common plastic types present in mixed MSW, followed by polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polystyrene (PS) and high density polyethylene (HDPE). If all the Finnish plastic packaging waste collected through the three collection types would be available for recycling, then 19,000\textendash 25,000 tons of recycled PP and 6000\textendash 8000 tons of recycled HDPE would be available on the local market. However, this assessment includes uncertainties due to performing the composition study only on mixed MSW plastic fraction. In order to obtain more precise figures of the recycling potential of post-consumer plastic packaging, more studies should be performed on both the quantities and the qualities of plastic wastes. The mechanical and rheological test results indicated that even plastic wastes originating from the mixed MSW, can be useful raw materials. Recycled HDPE showed a smaller decline in the mechanical properties than recycled PP. The origin and processing method of waste plastic seemed to have less effect on the mechanical quality than the type of plastic. The applicability of a plastic waste for a product needs to be assessed case by case, due to product specific quality requirements. In addition to mechanical properties, the chemical composition of plastic wastes is of major importance, in order to be able to restrict hazardous substances from being circulated undesirably. In addition to quantity and quality of plastic wastes, the sustainability of the whole recycling chain needs to be assessed prior to launching operations so that the chain can be optimized to generate both environmental and economic benefits to society and operators.},

  abstract = {We have measured the fracture toughness, Gc, of an interface between polystyrene (PS) and poly (2-vinylpyridine) (PVP) reinforced with triblock copolymers (PVP-b-dPS-b-PVP) as a function of the areal chain density, {$\Sigma$}, of the copolymers at the interface. The failure mechanisms of the interface are studied by transmission electron microscopy and forward recoil spectrometry. For triblock copolymers with long PVP blocks (NPVP {$>$} NePVP, where NePVP is the entanglement polymerization index of PVP), a transition from chain scission at low {$\Sigma$} to crazing at high {$\Sigma$}* is observed. By comparing the areal chain density {$\Sigma$}* for the transition from chain scission to crazing for the triblock copolymers ({$\Sigma$}* = 0.015 chains/nm2) to that for the diblock copolymers, PVP-dPS ({$\Sigma$}* = 0.03 chains/nm2), we show that most of the triblock copolymers form a ``staple'' structure at the interface with the dPS block making a loop on the PS side of the interface and the PVP ends anchoring the ``staple'' in the PVP side. As a result of the ``staple'' structure, the saturation areal chain density of the triblock copolymer ({$\Sigma$}sat) at the interface is half of that for the diblock copolymer of similar molecular weight. For {$\Sigma$} {$<$} {$\Sigma$}sat in the crazing regime, the fracture toughness of the interface is controlled by the areal joint density, {$\Sigma$}cross, where {$\Sigma$}cross is the number density of the copolymer excursions across the interface. For {$\Sigma$} {$>$} {$\Sigma$}sat, the triblock copolymers appear to reinforce the craze fibrils at the crack tip better than the corresponding diblock copolymers, leading to an interface fracture toughness approaching that of the PS homopolymer itself. For a triblock copolymer with short PVP blocks (NPVP {$<$} NePVP), there is a transition in the fracture mechanism from pull out of the PVP block to crazing with increasing {$\Sigma$}. Short triblock copolymers can form two chain conformations:\, one in which two PVP blocks anchor the copolymer on the homopolymer PVP side (staple structure) and one in which one PVP block anchors the copolymer on the PVP side (tail structure) of the interface. Comparison of Gc between the triblock copolymer and the corresponding diblock copolymer is made. The larger Gc values of the triblock copolymer reinforced interface in the crazing regime are observed as a result of enhancement in entanglements between the dPS loops of the triblock copolymer and the homopolymer PS.},

  abstract = {The fracture toughness, Gc, of the interface between a nitrogen plasma-treated poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) film and a poly(styrene-co-maleic anhydride) (PSMA) substrate was measured by using asymmetric double cantilever beam method. The effects of plasma treatment condition on PET films and post-plasma bonding treatment of the bi-material on the adhesion and the failure mechanism were investigated. For a given plasma pressure and energy, the amount of incorporated nitrogen on the PET surface as determined from X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS) increased with increasing plasma treatment time and reached a plateau value of 7.7at.\%. XPS measurement showed that the incorporated nitrogen was primarily in the form of amine and amide. For bonding temperatures between 130\textdegree C and 160\textdegree C, the fracture toughness increased with increasing nitrogen incorporation on PET surface and reached a saturation Gc which significantly depended on the bonding temperature. The saturation Gc increased from 10J/m2 at 130\textdegree C to 40J/m2 at 140\textdegree C, reached a maximum of 120J/m2 at 150\textdegree C, and then decreased to 60J/m2 at 160\textdegree C. The location of failure also changed drastically with the bonding temperature. SEM and XPS measurements showed that for bonding temperature{$<$}140\textdegree C, failure occurred at the PET/PSMA interface. For bonding temperature=150\textdegree C, the interfacial adhesion exceeded that of the cohesive strength of PET film and failure occurred within the PET film. At the bonding temperature of 160\textdegree C, failure occurred within PSMA bulk material. XPS measurement was used to measure the areal joint density, {$\Sigma$}cross of PSMA chains pinned on the functionalized PET film surface. A transition in areal joint density below which Gc scales linear with {$\Sigma$}cross and above which Gc scales with {$\Sigma$}cross2 was found. The transition was identified as the transition from the pure chain scission of in situ formed copolymers to plastic deformation of the interface.},

The addition of MAPP significantly improved mechanical properties such as tensile strength, flexural strength, tensile modulus, and flexural modulus compared with uncompatibilized composites, but decreased elongation at break. Scanning electron microscopic images of fracture surface specimens revealed better interfacial interaction between WF and polymer matrix for MAPP-compatibilized PP/r-PET/WF composites. MAPP-compatibilized PP/r-PET/WF composites also showed reduced water absorption due to improved interfacial bonding, which limited the amount of absorbable water molecules.

  abstract = {Recent advances in the field of additive manufacturing (AM) or 3D printing, have garnered serious interest for its potential to substitute time-consuming and costly subtractive and formative manufacturing techniques. Material extrusion (MatEx), employing filament and pellet-based feedstocks, is an AM technique for fabricating three-dimensional objects dictated by a computer-aided design (CAD) file in a layer-by-layer manner. Being inherently a ``melt-and-form'' technique, the physics of MatEx is strongly dependent on the melt flow behavior of the polymers and hence on their rheology. The focus of this review article is to analyze the current progress in rheological characterizations of filament and pellet-based polymeric feedstocks for application in MatEx. The importance of shear and temperature-dependent viscosities in relation to consistent extrusion through the print nozzle and in the standoff region between nozzle and bed will be highlighted. The importance of shear and/or extensional viscosities and extent of die swell (upon exit from the nozzle) experienced by the polymers under processing parameters relevant to MatEx will be investigated. Postextrusion from the nozzle, the rheological characteristics of the viscous polymer melt as it cools once deposited on the print bed governs the degree of interlayer welding, that impacts the mechanical performance of the printed parts. Controlling and monitoring rheological properties such as zero-shear viscosities and shear moduli of the melt is of significant importance in this region in order to ensure proper mechanical robustness and shape integrity of the deposited layers. Both experimental and theoretical approaches based on polymer chain reptation mechanisms will be reviewed in detail and suggestions to address the existing limitations associated with the process will be provided. Fundamental understanding of the correlation between the classical theories and current understanding based on recent experimentation and analysis is expected to assist the design and development of the next generation of polymer feedstocks and machine designs for MatEx-based AM.},

  abstract = {The trend of growth and aging of population worldwide will pose new challenges in health care, which will require faster solutions addressed to specific pacient needs. In this regard, additive manufacturing (AM) is a group of promising technologies capable of delivering custom biomedical parts of high complexity in reduced lead time. Although it has emerged commercially in the 1980s as a rapid prototyping and modeling technique, it is now applied to production of a wide range of shapes with various possible materials. In this work, the technological aspects of each type of AM process were reviewed according to their advantages, limitations and potential or current applications for the production of medical devices. Direct comparisons of resolution, price and printing speed made possible to identify the most important niche for each AM process in health care sciences. In one hand, the many variables involved make these processes difficult to model and control, but in the other hand, they allow fine tuning of the microstructure to produce purposeful anisotropy, porosity and varying chemical composition, which may be desired in many medical devices. In addition, since the AM technologies have different working principles and feedstock requirements, the historic concept and classification of biomaterials were also assessed in view of their application for tissue engineering, implantable devices and surgery equipment among other uses. The discussion of materials and manufacturing methods was based on several research works and commercial products, which show a extremely fast developing field with a broad range of current and future possibilities in terms of biomedical applications.},

The distributed manufacturing methods included mechanical grinding to fused granular fabrication, heated syringe printing, 3-D printed molds coupled to injection molding and filament production in a recyclebot to fused filament fabrication. The particle size, angle of repose, thermal and rheological properties are characterized for the two sub-materials to define the conditions for the extrusion. A successful pathway for fabricating new products was found and the mechanical properties of the resultant components were quantified. Finally, the means to convert scrap windshield wiper blades into useful, high-value, bespoke biomedical products of fingertip grips for hand prosthetics was demonstrated.

  abstract = {The circular economy (CE) aims to radically improve resource efficiency by eliminating the concept of waste and leading to a shift away from the linear take-make-waste model. In a CE, resources are flowing in a circular manner either in a biocycle (biomass) or technocycle (inorganic materials). While early studies indicate that 3D printing (3DP) holds substantial promise for sustainability and the creation of a CE, there is no guarantee that it will do so. There is great uncertainty regarding whether the current trajectory of 3DP adoption is creating more circular material flows or if it is leading to an alternative scenario in which less eco-efficient localised production, demands for customised goods, and a higher rate of product obsolescence combine to bring about increased resource consumption. It is critical that CE principles are embedded into the new manufacturing system before the adoption of 3DP reaches a critical inflection point in which negative practices become entrenched. This paper, authored by both academic and industry experts, proposes a research agenda to determine enablers and barriers for 3DP to achieve a CE. We explore the two following overarching questions to discover what specific issues they entail: (1) How can a more distributed manufacturing system based on 3DP create a circular economy of closed-loop material flows? (2) What are the barriers to a circular 3D printing economy? We specifically examine six areas\textemdash design, supply chains, information flows, entrepreneurship, business models and education\textemdash with the aim of formulating a research agenda to enable 3DP to reach its full potential for a CE.},

Washing temperature showed a significant influence on the removal of absorbed chemicals from surfaces compared with the effect of the caustic and especially the additive concentration. Optimization of caustic cleaning for the cleaning process in question led to better cleaning effectiveness, although none of the different washing conditions were able to remove all absorbed chemicals out of the polymeric resins.

However, the applications of the FDM process are still limited due to several drawbacks, such as poor surface quality, poor mechanical properties, or high built time. It has been deemed that the part characteristics and build time can be improved by determining an optimum combination of process parameters. To optimize multiple process parameters in FDM, this paper employs a multi-objective particle swarm optimization based on the data collected from the experimental study. Four (04) process parameters, namely layer thickness, build orientation, infill density, and extrusion temperature are optimized to achieve higher compressive strength and lower build time. The optimization results provide information on the combined impacts of the four process parameters on compressive strength and build time. This information can aid decision makers with better judgment when dealing with multiple conflicting objectives.},

The reduction of natural resource exploration and recovery of waste are examples of actions to contribute to a sustainable development. Waste from end-of-life tires and undifferentiated plastics represents an environmental problem due to the very high number of tons of used tires and plastics produced, but with a high economic potential because their incorporation into high value-added products is an issue of utmost importance. The manufacturing technologies oriented to the increase in quality levels, functional advantages, structural and financial gains of the produced products are currently a hot topic in industry. Similarly, the use of additive manufacturing technologies, instead of conventional techniques, e.g. moulding to process materials obtained from waste recovery, is a great industrial challenge. In order to promote greater environmental responsibility and to present innovative solutions for the management and sustainable destination of used waste recovery from tires and undifferentiated plastics, a composite made from the blend of 60\% of tire waste granulate and 40\% of polypropylene (PP) recycled was tested with the final purpose of generating components with added value. Both waste recovery materials were used in the micronized state. The thermal and mechanical behaviours of the synthesized composite were studied through DSC/TGA analysis and tensile testing. The implementation of additive manufacturing methodologies to process the blends between used tires granulated with a high incorporation of wastes from undifferentiated plastics was also explored in this work in order to produce big green parts without mould needed, such as urban furniture.},

  abstract = {Polypropylene/poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PP/PET) blends, compatibilised by glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) and diallyl phthalate (DAP) grafted PP [PP-g-(DAP-co-GMA)], were prepared under the different draw ratio (DR). The effect of DR on the properties of resultant blends was investigated by scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, rheological analysis, tensile and heat resistance tests. The results showed that the compatibility of PP/PET blends could be improved by PP-g-(DAP-co-GMA); as the increase of DR, the morphology of PET dispersed phase evolved as follows: spherical particleellipsoidal particle stubby fibre lathy fibre bitty fibre, compared with the PET spherical particle, the PET microfibre possessed stronger heterogeneous nucleation effect on the crystallisation of PP, which was in favour of the improvement of crystallinity of PP. As a result, the mechanical properties and heat resistance were also enhanced obviously. The rheological analysis revealed that the complex viscosity ({$\eta$}*), storage modulus (G{${'}$}) and loss modulus (G{${''}$}) were dependent on the morphology of PET. The viscoelasticity of the blends is improved when the PET was in the form of microfibre.},

It enables us to unpack the evolutionary nuances of a specific field, while shedding light on the emerging areas in that field. Yet, its application in business research is relatively new, and in many instances, underdeveloped. Accordingly, we endeavor to present an overview of the bibliometric methodology, with a particular focus on its different techniques, while offering step-by-step guidelines that can be relied upon to rigorously perform bibliometric analysis with confidence. To this end, we also shed light on when and how bibliometric analysis should be used vis-\`a-vis other similar techniques such as meta-analysis and systematic literature reviews. As a whole, this paper should be a useful resource for gaining insights on the available techniques and procedures for carrying out studies using bibliometric analysis.},

Thirty-five 3D models of large (aortic, wall thickness of 2 mm, n = 30) and small (coronary, wall thickness of 1.25 mm, n = 5) vessels printed with fused deposition modeling (FDM) (rigid, n = 20) and PolyJet (flexible, n = 15) technology were subjected to high-resolution CT scans. From the resulting DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) dataset, an STL file was generated and wall thickness as well as surface congruency were compared with the original STL file using dedicated 3D engineering software. The mean wall thickness for the large-scale aortic models was 2.11 \textmu m (+5\%), and 1.26 \textmu m (+0.8\%) for the coronary models, resulting in an overall mean wall thickness of +5\% for all 35 3D models when compared to the original STL file. The mean surface deviation was found to be +120 \textmu m for all models, with +100 \textmu m for the aortic and +180 \textmu m for the coronary 3D models, respectively. Both printing technologies were found to conform with the currently set standards of accuracy (\&lt;1 mm), demonstrating that accurate 3D models of large and small vessel anatomy can be generated by both FDM and PolyJet printing technology using rigid and flexible polymers.},

The following copolymers in which A and B segments represent poly(styrene-d8) and poly(4-hydroxystyrene), respectively, have been prepared:\, poly(A-graft-B), poly(B-graft-A), poly(B-block-A-block-B), poly(A-block-B-block-A-block-B-block-A). The poly(4-hydroxystyrene) segments were obtained by ``living'' radical polymerization of 4-acetoxystyrene or anionic polymerization of 4-methoxystyrene, followed by conversion to the phenolic derivative. In general, the amphiphilic copolymers when placed at the PS/PVP interface acted as interfacial reinforcers but were susceptible to the formation of microphases such as lamellae or micelles, and therefore the measured fracture toughness depended on both the copolymer/homopolymer interfacial strength and the toughness of the copolymer phase structure itself. The pentablock copolymer showed better strengthening behavior than the triblock copolymer especially at very low areal chain density. The strengthening ability of the graft copolymers was found to depend on the lengths of the polystyrene, PS, and poly(4-hydroxystyrene), PS(OH), segments. In both graft and block copolymers the PS(OH) segments were found to resist pull-out from the bulk PVP even at low degrees of polymerization (NPS(OH) = 29). The H-bonding interaction between the phenolic and pyridyl groups combined with the severe immiscibility of poly(4-hydroxystyrene) and polystyrene is the most likely cause for pull-out resistance.},

  abstract = {Two biobased polymers, poly(trimethylene terephthalate) (PTT) and high density polyethylene with varying concentrations were injection molded for their performance evaluation. Differential scanning calorimetry determined that the majority of the blends exhibited a cold crystallization peak in the first heating cycle. Dynamic mechanical analysis revealed an increase in the storage modulus after the material has passed its Tg which can be related to the material's ability to cold crystallization. Blending demonstrated intermediate values for the tensile and flexural properties in comparison to each neat polymer. However, the notched Izod impact strength was higher for blends containing less than 50 wt.\% biobased polyethylene (BioPE) compared to the virgin materials. The best performance in comparison to the other blends was observed for the PTT/BioPE (80/20) wt.\% formulation, which had balanced tensile and flexural properties and an increase of 64\% in the impact strength. This was explained through the impact fracture morphology via scanning electron microscopy. Variations in PTT and BioPE loading resulted in different surface structures, phase distributions and particle sizes. PTT as the minor phase resulted in randomly distributed large spheres. Whereas, when BioPE was the minor phase, it formed small uniform spherical/rod-like structures. Smaller particle size provided a toughening effect on the impact strength.},

  abstract = {Recycling of plastic is an important step towards circular economy. However, plastic from household waste (HHW) is a heterogeneous and contaminated resource, leading to recycled plastic with reduced quality, limiting the potential for closed-loop recycling. In addition to regulatory requirements for the chemical composition of recycled plastic, reduced physical and mechanical properties may limit the potential for closed-loop recycling. Consequently, this study analyses the thermal degradation, processability and mechanical properties of a range of reprocessed PET, PE and PP samples from source-separated plastic in HHW. On this basis, the potential for closed-loop recycling is evaluated. The study demonstrated that PET, PE and PP recycling represent different challenges. Potential degradation of the PET polymer can be reversed in a decontamination process, making PET waste well-suited for closed-loop, multiple times recycling, even when the degree of heterogeneity in the waste is high. The processability of different kinds of PE and PP packaging types varied considerably, especially for PP. Consequently, current recycling of mixed PP waste and even separate recycling of individual PP waste packaging types, will not technically facilitate recycling into new packaging products. This highlights the importance of PE and PP waste homogeneity when sent to reprocessing. Such homogeneity may be achieved through additional plastic sorting and regulatory harmonisation of product design, accounting for polymer properties and recyclability. Degradation of PP during recycling was shown to be substantial, representing another important limitation for PP recycling, necessary to address in the future.},

The composite morphology was determined by scanning electron microscopy. The composite viscosity increased with filler content, suggesting possible formation of filler agglomerates.

  abstract = {Purpose \textendash{} The purpose of this paper is to investigate the use of medical-grade polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) in fused deposition modeling (FDM) to fabricate porous customized freeform structures for several applications including craniofacial reconstruction and orthopaedic spacers. It also aims to examine the effects of different fabrication conditions on porosity and mechanical properties of PMMA samples. Design/methodology/approach \textendash{} The building parameters and procedures to properly and consistently extrude PMMA filament in FDM for building 3D structures were determined. Two experiments were performed that examined the effects of different fabrication conditions, including tip wipe frequency, layer orientation, and air gap (AG) (or distance between filament edges) on the mechanical properties and porosity of the fabricated structures. The samples were characterized through optical micrographs, and measurements of weight and dimensions of the samples were used to calculate porosity. The yield strength, strain, and modulus of elasticity of the samples were determined through compressive testing. Findings \textendash{} Results show that both the tip wipe frequency (one wipe every layer or one wipe every ten layers) and layer orientation (transverse or axial with respect to the applied compressive load) used to fabricate the scaffolds have effects on the mechanical properties and resulting porosity. The samples fabricate in the transverse orientation with the high tip wipe frequency have a larger compressive strength and modulus than the lower tip wipe frequency samples (compressive strength: 16{$\pm$}0.97 vs 13{$\pm$}0.71 MPa, modulus: 370{$\pm$}14 vs 313{$\pm$}29 MPa, for the high vs low tip wipe frequency, respectively). Also, the samples fabricated in the transverse orientation have a larger compressive strength and modulus than the ones fabricated in the axial orientation (compressive strength: 16{$\pm$}0.97 vs 13{$\pm$}0.83 MPa, modulus: 370{$\pm$}14 vs 281{$\pm$}22 MPa; for samples fabricated with one tip wipe per layer in the transverse and axial orientations, respectively). In general, the stiffness and yield strength decreased when the porosity increased (compressive strength: 12{$\pm$}0.71 to 7{$\pm$}0.95 MPa, Modulus: 248{$\pm$}10 to 165{$\pm$}16 MPa, for samples with a porosity ranging from 55 to 70 percent). As a demonstration, FDM is successfully used to fabricate patient-specific, 3D PMMA implants with varying densities, including cranial defect repair and femur models. Originality/value \textendash{} This paper demonstrates that customized, 3D, biocompatible PMMA structures with varying porosities can be designed and directly fabricated using FDM. By enabling the use of PMMA in FDM, medical implants such as custom craniofacial implants can be directly fabricated from medical imaging data improving the current state of PMMA use in medicine.},

There is a need to provide awareness of their uses and routine management as a part of our lifestyle. Nowadays, plastics are increasingly being used in our daily life activities, including the packaging in different food and brewing companies, cosmetics, pharmaceutical, and other production sectors need to pack their end products for efficient and safer product's delivery to the community. Plastics are produced through the biochemical process of polymerization or polycondensation. The post-use of generated plastic waste has many adverse impacts on the environment if not processed and managed in a proper way. This review aims to discuss the lifecycle of plastic products according to their different categories, including polyvinyl chloride (PVC\textendash U), polystyrene or styrofoam (PS), polypropylene (PP), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polyethylene terephthalate (PETE), and others. Herein, we have also discussed the problems caused by the inadequate processing of plastic waste and the possible solutions that can be provided to ensure a good atmosphere and to reduce the causes of climate changes, which is challenging to life on this planet.},

While respiratory symptoms are commonly caused by the infection, the use of mechanical ventilation is required for some patients. The following is intended to review the development and testing of a 3D printed and open-source mechanical ventilation device that is capable of adjusting breathing rate, volume, and pressure simultaneously and was designed according to the latest clinical observations of the current pandemic.

The pastes exhibit a characteristic shear thinning behaviour with yield stresses that can reach values above 1kPa and depend mostly on their solid content and the particle size distribution. It is possible to formulate printable Al2O3 and SiC inks with solid contents as high as 40 vol\% that reached densities up to 95th\% for SiC and 97th\% for Al2O3 with flexural strengths of 300MPa and 230MPa respectively after sintering.

Subsequently, the chosen technique for optimization is presented, with evidence of its application viability that suggests that a quality advance would be gathered with such.

Moreover, with this technology, a circular economy approach involving the use of pellets made from plastic waste can be easily implemented. Polylactic Acid (PLA) pellets were processed at different printing speeds and with different infill percentages on a customized version of a commercial Prusa i3 Plus 3D printer modified with a Mahor screw extruder. For the characterization of the 3D printed samples, rheological, thermal, mechanical and porosity analyses were carried out. In addition, the energy consumption of the 3D printer was monitored during the production of the specimens. The results showed that a higher printing speed leads to lower energy consumption, without compromising material strength, whereas a slower printing speed is preferable to increase material stiffness.},

In this study, we developed different prototypes of masks, exclusively applying basic additive manufacturing technologies like fused deposition modeling (FDM) and droplet-based precision extrusion deposition (db-PED) to common food packaging materials. We analyzed the resulting mechanical characteristics, biological safety (cell adhesion and viability), surface roughness and resistance to dissolution, before and after the cleaning and disinfection phases. We showed that masks 3D printed with home-grade printing equipment have similar performances compared to the industrial-grade ones, and furthermore we obtained a perfect face fit by customizing their shape.

That is a limitation considering the wide diffusion of dual extruders printers and the possibility of increasing the number of these extruders. An exploratory study, based on tensile tests and performed on double-material butt-joined bars, was thus conceived; the aim was to explore how the adhesion strength between 3 pairs of filaments (TPU-PLA, PLA-CPE, CPE-TPU) is influenced by the material printing order, the type of slicing pattern used for the layers at the interface, and the infill density of the layers below the interface.

Besides, thermal aspects also demonstrated to play a relevant role in influencing the performance of the interface.},

  abstract = {Plastic waste is a major challenge for policy making; it has a terrible impact on the environment if it is not properly managed. In order to mitigate this issue, recycling industries have emerged with the associated logistics chain that also has an environmental impact, notably with the production of greenhouse gas. In addition to using energy to transform plastic waste into source material, energy is also wasted to transport it. In parallel to reducing plastic waste, it may be recycled at a very local scale, reducing transportation and allowing potential improvement of the collecting process. Assuming that local transformation of plastic waste is possible, this article describes the design, assembly, and setup of the hardware, system architecture, and software of collectors that may be used by these recycling units. The specificity of these collectors is that they produces on-line data related to the quantity of waste collected. Once implemented, a network of smart collectors should allow the reduction of travel to collect waste as it notifies when the collectors are full. It also produces data on the scale of a territory to optimize the supply chain related to plastic waste collection. This article presents the design and engineering aspects as well as limitations induced by technical choices, but also potential improvements for future developments.},

Results from mechanical testing indicate that the e-waste plastics filaments and its 3D prints exhibit up to 76 and 83\% of breaking and tensile strength respectively of its virgin counterparts produced from a widely used plastic for 3D printing, i.e., ABS. The 3D prints from e-waste plastic were more flexible compared to those from virgin plastics. SEM analysis of the fractured surface of the 3D prints post tensile testing is also presented in the paper. Furthermore, LCA studies on our filament production process indicate 28\% reduction in CO2 emissions while using e-waste plastics as feedstock as compared to virgin plastics. Effects of repeated recycling, up to four extrusion cycles, on the virgin and e-waste plastic filaments were studied, and a comprehensive semiquantitative degradation mechanism for the same was proposed using results from 13C NMR and TGA analysis.}

Although FFF is evolving into a manufacturing tool with significant technological and material advancements, there remains a challenge to transfer FFF-printed parts into functional objects for practical applications. Polymer components fabricated by FFF technique exhibit weak and anisotropic mechanical properties compared to their counterparts by conventional processing. The limited mechanical property for the FFF-printed parts is a result of weak interlayer bond interface that develops during the layer-wise deposition process. This review documents recent advances on the bond interface in FFF-printed parts in aspects of its mechanisms, characterization and enhancement methods. The main objective is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the process-structure-properties of interlayer bond in FFF technique.},

  abstract = {Management decisions underpinning availability of ecosystem services and the organisms that provide them in agroecosystems, such as pollinators and pollination services, have emerged as a foremost consideration for both conservation and crop production goals. There is growing evidence that innovative management practices can support diverse pollinators and increase crop pollination. However, there is also considerable debate regarding factors that support adoption of these innovative practices. This study investigated pollination management practices and related knowledge systems in a major crop producing region of southwest Michigan in the United States, where 367 growers were surveyed to evaluate adoption of three innovative practices that are at various stages of adoption. The goals of this quantitative, social survey were to investigate grower experience with concerns and benefits associated with each practice, as well as the influence of grower networks, which are comprised of contacts that reflect potential pathways for social and technical learning. The results demonstrated that 17\% of growers adopted combinations of bees (e.g. honey bees, Apis mellifera, with other species), representing an innovation in use by early adopters; 49\% of growers adopted flowering cover crops, an innovation in use by the early majority 55\% of growers retained permanent habitat for pollinators, an innovation in use by the late majority. Not all growers adopted innovative practices. We found that growers' personal experience with potential benefits and concerns related to the management practices had significant positive and negative relationships, respectively, with adoption of all three innovations. The influence of these communication links likely has different levels of importance, depending on the stage of the adoption that a practice is experiencing in the agricultural community. Social learning was positively associated with adopting the use of combinations of bees, highlighting the potentially critical roles of peer-to-peer networks and social learning in supporting early stages of adoption of innovations. Engaging with grower networks and understanding grower experience with benefits and concerns associated with innovative practices is needed to inform outreach, extension, and policy efforts designed to stimulate management innovations in agroecosystems.},

  abstract = {The particle size and shape distributions of metal powders used in additive manufacturing powder bed fusion processes are of technological importance for the final built product. Current three-dimensional (3D) measurements of these distributions assume a spherical shape, while techniques that measure both size and shape are always two-dimensional (2D) measurements of particle projections. This paper describes a set of techniques using X-ray computed tomography, combined with various mathematical algorithms, to measure the 3D size, shape, and internal porosity of individual particles. Calibrated by a limited amount of visual examination of 3D images of individual particles, these techniques can classify powder particles as single near-spherical (SnS) particles, and non-spherical (NS) particles, which consist of either single highly non-spherical particles or multiparticles, where two or more smaller particles have been joined together. From this 3D data, other algorithms can generate 2D particle size and shape information to compare with the results of 2D measurement techniques. These techniques are applied to two metal powders composed of a specific alloy of titanium with aluminum and vanadium, denoted as Ti64, which is in common use as a powder for selective laser or electron beam melting powder bed additive manufacturing. One powder was made with a gas-atomization process, the other with a plasma-atomization process, both have been recycled, and both pass the specifications for additive manufacturing use. The powders differ in the fraction of NS particles and porous particles, in their size and shape distributions, and in average shape and size statistics. The SnS/NS classification enables one to show how these classes contribute to the overall particle size distributions, even for a single powder type, and is useful for comparing different sources of powder as well as studying how the size/shape distributions of a powder might change over multiple recycling events.},

Findings The investigation found that most authors were concerned about the energy consumption of the AM equipment, which is the subject studied by 87\% of articles. In addition, 25\% of the studies used LCA at least in some level, making a global environment assessment to evaluate the environmental impacts of AM. By analyzing research studies, it was possible to find signs that AM could be a lower environmental impact process, when compared with traditional manufacturing. However, this assumption is not valid in all cases because there are many variables that may affect environmental results. Originality/value Due to the increase on the usage of this type of technology by industries, studies on the environmental performance of this process became relevant.},

  abstract = {The study evaluated the impacts of plastic pollution on the sustainability of seafood value chain. The world aquaculture production in 2016 stood at 80.0 million tons of food fish, gradually declined by 0.3 million tons to 79.7 million tons in 2017, and rose to 81.4 million tons in 2018. Global aquaculture production maintained relatively steady increase from 2011 to 2018. Plastic pollution can afflict oceans, land, and waterways. It is estimated that about 1.1 to 8.8 million metric tons of plastic waste enters the world ocean from coastal communities every year. Living organisms, mostly marine animals, can be injured either by the mechanical effects, such as the entanglement in plastic objects and problems related to the ingestion of plastic wastes, or via exposure to chemicals in plastics that interfere with their body physiology. Also, humans are affected by plastic pollution, by disruption of various hormonal mechanisms, etc. The mainstream plastic wastes accumulations in the environment have adversely affected both terrestrial and aquatic wildlife and wildlife habitat (habitation); with humans utterly affected by the growing rate of plastic pollution. More than 5 trillion pieces and fragments of plastic wastes are distributed in the world oceans worldwide. If the plastic pollution problem is not solved, by 2050, there possibly will be more plastic wastes in the world oceans, rivers, lakes, etc. than fishes and other aquatic organisms; this puts the sustainability of seafood value chain in threat. There are three main pathways by which plastic debris always affect wildlife; entanglement, ingestion, interaction. Entanglement in plastic debris is responsible for the deaths (both reported and unreported) of many aquatic organisms, such as fish, seals, and turtles, as well as birds. These marine animals get caught up in the plastic debris and end up suffocating/drowning. Greenpeace International (2018) stated that in a 2006 report called Plastic Debris in the World's Oceans, it was estimated that over 267 different species of animals have suffered entanglement and plastic debris ingestion. It was estimated that at least 400,000 aquatic mammals perish annually as a result of plastic pollution in oceans. Interaction includes the contact with plastic debris (with exclusion of entanglement) including abrasions, use as substrate, collisions, and obstructions. Many marine animals, especially Whales and Sea turtles, are affected by the pollution caused by plastics through ingestion. Large quantities of plastic wastes have been found in stomachs of beached whales. A pilot whale was found almost dead in June 2018, and later died, in a water canal at Southern Thailand close to the border with Malaysia after it swallowed more than 80 pieces of plastic bags which weighed up to 3Ib. Some species of sea turtle are jelly fish consumers, but regularly mistake plastic bags for their natural prey, jelly fish. This plastic debris may kill the sea turtle by the obstruction of its oesophagus. Deep sea animal species have been found with quantities of plastics in their stomachs. Microplastics ingestions have been indicated to occur for various organisms.},

In comparison with SLM stainless steel 316L, this paper introduces an innovative AM process for making austenitic stainless steel 316L parts using a metal\textendash polymer composite filament (Ultrafuse 316LX). Stainless steel 316L metal specimens were printed using a material extrusion (FDM)-based three-dimensional (3D) printer loaded with Ultrafuse filament, followed by an industry-standard debinding and sintering process. Tests were performed to understand the material properties, such as hardness, tensile strength, and microstructural characteristics. Part shrinkage was also analyzed based on the features of the FDM stainless steel 316L component. A preliminary guideline on how to select among these two alternative AM processes for fabrication of metal parts is discussed.},

The technology permits the manufacture of tablets containing drug doses tailored to individual patients, or to fabrication of tablets with specific drug-release profiles. Commercially produced polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) filament was loaded with a model drug (fluorescein) by swelling of the polymer in ethanolic drug solution. A final drug-loading of 0.29\% w/w was achieved. Tablets of PVA/fluorescein (10mm diameter) were printed using a 3D printer. It was found that changing the degree of infill percentage in the printer software varied the weight and volume of the printed tablets. The tablets were mechanically strong and no significant thermal degradation of the active occurred during printing. Dissolution tests were conducted in modified Hank's buffer. The results showed release profiles were dependent on the infill percentage used to print the tablet. The study indicates that FF 3DP has the potential to offer a new solution for fabricating personalized-dose medicines or unit dosage forms with controlled-release profiles. In addition, the low cost of FDM printers means the paradigm of extemporaneous or point-of-use manufacture of personalized-dose tablets is both feasible and attainable.},

  abstract = {Three dimensional printing (3D printing) was used to fabricate novel oral drug delivery devices with specialized design configurations. Each device was loaded with multiple actives, with the intent of applying this process to the production of personalized medicines tailored at the point of dispensing or use. A filament extruder was used to obtain drug-loaded\textemdash paracetamol (acetaminophen) or caffeine\textemdash filaments of poly(vinyl alcohol) with characteristics suitable for use in fused-deposition modeling 3D printing. A multinozzle 3D printer enabled fabrication of capsule-shaped solid devices containing the drug with different internal structures. The design configurations included a multilayer device, with each layer containing drug, whose identity was different to the drug in the adjacent layers, and a two-compartment device comprising a caplet embedded within a larger caplet (DuoCaplet), with each compartment containing a different drug. Raman spectroscopy was used to collect 2-dimensional hyper spectral arrays across the entire surface of the devices. Processing of the arrays using direct classical least-squares component matching to produce false color representations of distribution of the drugs was used. This clearly showed a definitive separation between the drug layers of paracetamol and caffeine. Drug release tests in biorelevant bicarbonate media showed unique drug release profiles dependent on the macrostructure of the devices. In the case of the multilayer devices, release of both paracetamol and caffeine was simultaneous and independent of drug solubility. With the DuoCaplet design, it was possible to engineer either rapid drug release or delayed release by selecting the site of incorporation of the drug in the device; the lag-time for release from the internal compartment was dependent on the characteristics of the external layer. The study confirms the potential of 3D printing to fabricate multiple-drug containing devices with specialized design configurations and unique drug release characteristics, which would not otherwise be possible using conventional manufacturing methods.},

We match our experimental results with FEM simulations that provide insight into the origin of the stresses developed during printing. Because HDPE forms a significant fraction of the plastic waste stream, conversion of waste-derived HDPE to 3D printing filament has important technological implications.},

  abstract = {Biodegradable stents (BRS) offer enormous potential but first they must meet five specific requirements: (i) their manufacturing process must be precise; (ii) degradation should have minimal toxicity; (iii) the rate of degradation should match the recovery rate of vascular tissue; (iv) ideally, they should induce rapid endothelialization to restore the functions of vascular tissue, but at the same time reduce the risk of restenosis; and (v) their mechanical behavior should comply with medical requirements, namely, the flexibility required to facilitate placement but also sufficient radial rigidity to support the vessel. Although the first three requirements have been comprehensively studied, the last two have been overlooked. One possible way of addressing these issues would be to fabricate composite stents using materials that have different mechanical, biological, or medical properties, for instance, Polylactide Acid (PLA) or Polycaprolactone (PCL). However, fashioning such stents using the traditional stent manufacturing process known as laser cutting would be impossible. Our work, therefore, aims to produce PCL/PLA composite stents using a novel 3D tubular printer based on Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM). The cell geometry (shape and area) and the materials (PCL and PLA) of the stents were analyzed and correlated with 3T3 cell proliferation, degradation rates, dynamic mechanical and radial expansion tests to determine the best parameters for a stent that will satisfy the five strict BRS requirements. Results proved that the 3D-printing process was highly suitable for producing composite stents (approximately 85\&ndash;95\% accuracy). Both PCL and PLA demonstrated their biocompatibility with PCL stents presenting an average cell proliferation of 12.46\% and PLA 8.28\% after only 3 days. Furthermore, the PCL/PLA composite stents demonstrated their potential in degradation, dynamic mechanical and expansion tests. Moreover, and regardless of the order of the layers, the composite stents showed (virtually) medium levels of degradation rates and mechanical modulus. Radially, they exhibited the virtues of PCL in the expansion step (elasticity) and those of PLA in the recoil step (rigidity). Results have clearly demonstrated that composite PCL/PLA stents are a highly promising solution to fulfilling the rigorous BRS requirements.},

  abstract = {Although the trend in manufacturing has been towards centralization to leverage economies of scale, the recent rapid technical development of open-source 3-D printers enables low-cost distributed bespoke production. This paper explores the potential advantages of a distributed manufacturing model of high-value products by investigating the application of 3-D printing to self-refraction eyeglasses. A series of parametric 3-D printable designs is developed, fabricated and tested to overcome limitations identified with mass-manufactured self-correcting eyeglasses designed for the developing world's poor. By utilizing 3-D printable self-adjustable glasses, communities not only gain access to far more diversity in product design, as the glasses can be customized for the individual, but 3-D printing also offers the potential for significant cost reductions. The results show that distributed manufacturing with open-source 3-D printing can empower developing world communities through the ability to print less expensive and customized self-adjusting eyeglasses. This offers the potential to displace both centrally manufactured conventional and self-adjusting glasses while completely eliminating the costs of the conventional optics correction experience, including those of highly-trained optometrists and ophthalmologists and their associated equipment. Although, this study only analyzed a single product, it is clear that other products would benefit from the same approach in isolated regions of the developing world.},

  abstract = {The release of the open source 3-D printer known as the RepRap (a self-Replicating Rapid prototyper) resulted in the potential for distributed manufacturing of products for significantly lower costs than conventional manufacturing. This development, coupled with open source-appropriate technology (OSAT), has enabled the opportunity for 3-D printers to be used for sustainable development. In this context, OSAT provides the opportunity to modify and improve the physical designs of their printers and desired digitally-shared objects. However, these 3-D printers require electricity while more than a billion people still lack electricity. To enable the utilization of RepRaps in off-grid communities, solar photovoltaic (PV)-powered mobile systems have been developed, but recent improvements in novel delta-style 3-D printer designs allows for reduced costs and improved performance. This study builds on these innovations to develop and experimentally validate a mobile solar-PV-powered delta 3-D printer system. It is designed to run the RepRap 3-D printer regardless of solar flux. The electrical system design is tested outdoors for operating conditions: (1) PV charging battery and running 3-D printer; (2) printing under low insolation; (3) battery powering the 3-D printer alone; (4) PV charging the battery only; and (5) battery fully charged with PV-powered 3-D printing. The results show the system performed as required under all conditions providing feasibility for adoption in off-grid rural communities. 3-D printers powered by affordable mobile PV solar systems have a great potential to reduce poverty through employment creation, as well as ensuring a constant supply of scarce products for isolated communities.},

This results in the generation of thousands of tons of residual polymeric packaging waste, which is either left behind in the environment or otherwise recycled or incinerated at a cost of several millions of U.S. dollars per year. Advancements in distributed recycling technologies now allow for on-demand reconstitution of traditionally neglected MRE pouch waste into useful appliances via material extrusion additive manufacturing. In this work, we demonstrate recycling of MRE pouch materials through a combined compounding, filament extrusion, and fused filament fabrication (FFF) additive manufacturing protocol. Mechanical properties and barrier properties of additively manufactured structures were evaluated through tensile testing and water vapor transmission testing, respectively, and found to be comparable to the native pouch materials. Differential Scanning Calorimetry and Thermogravimetric Analysis of the extruded filament and printed materials were contrasted with native pouch materials, showing minimal effects of the manufacturing process on critical thermal transitions in the polymer. Economics and viability of on-demand reconstitution using these proposed methods are briefly discussed and reveal the multiple benefits of this recycling process.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the potential of self-made polyester-urethane filament as a candidate for Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF)-based 3D printing (3DP) in medical applications. Since the industry does not provide many ready-made solutions of medical-grade polyurethane filaments, we undertook research aimed at presenting the process of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) filament formation, detailed characteristics, and 3DP of specially designed elastic porous structures as candidates in cancellous tissue engineering. Additionally, we examined whether 3D printing affects the structure and thermal stability of the filament. According to the obtained results, the processing parameters leading to the formation of high-quality TPU filament (TPU\_F) were captured. The results showed that TPU\_F remains stable under the FFF 3DP conditions. The series of in vitro studies involving long- and short-term degradation (0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS); 5 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH)), cytotoxicity (ISO 10993:5) and bioactivity (simulated body fluid (SBF) incubation), showed that TPU printouts possessing degradability of long-term degradable tissue constructs, are biocompatible and susceptible to mineralization in terms of hydroxyapatite (HAp) formation during SBF exposure. The formation of HAp on the surface of the specially designed porous tissue structures (PTS) was confirmed by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) studies. The compression test of PTS showed that the samples were strengthened due to SBF exposure and deposited HAp on their surface. Moreover, the determined values of the tensile strength (\textasciitilde 30 MPa), Young\&rsquo;s modulus (\textasciitilde 0.2 GPa), and compression strength (\textasciitilde 1.1 MPa) allowed pre-consideration of TPU\_F for FFF 3DP of cancellous bone tissue structures.},

A novel extrusion device, eccentric rotor extruder (ERE), was developed to supply such flow during the process. Including morphology, mechanical properties, melting behavior, and rheological behavior were studied. The morphological study showed that the compatibility between LLDPE and PET was greatly improved with LLDPE loading up to 80 wt \%. Mechanical tests indicated that LLDPE could toughen PET to some extent. Moreover, a comparison of samples prepared between ERE and conventional extruder was made and demonstrated the sample prepared by ERE can exhibit better mechanical properties. Differential scanning calorimetry results revealed that PET can promote the crystallinity of LLDPE. Rheological behavior indicated that the complex viscosity of the blends exhibited strong shear thinning phenomenon with increasing LLDPE content, particularly in high-frequency range blend with the LLDPE weight ratio of 80 wt \% was more sensitivity to shear rate than neat LLDPE. The G{${'}$}-G{${''}$} curves of the blends also revealed that the microstructure of the blends changed significantly with the addition of LLDPE which was consistent with the scanning electron micrographs that PET particles became smaller and distributed more uniform with increasing LLDPE content. Furthermore, the blends showed similar stress relaxation mechanism with adding LLDPE content from 60 to 100 wt \%. \textcopyright{} 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym.

The phase morphology, rheological properties, crystallization behavior, and mechanical properties of the fabricated blends were carefully studied to explore the effect of the elongational flow field on the dispersion and mixing of PET in the m-PE matrix and the interface of the two immiscible polymers. For comparison, a conventional twin-screw extruder (TSE) was used to prepare the same blends as references using the same processing condition. It shows that the elongational flow field in ERE is much more effective to disperse the immiscible PET in the m-PE matrix with a smaller particle size and a narrower particle size distribution, compared to the shear flow field in TSE. A compatibilizer, ethylene-co-methyl acrylate-co-glycidyl methacrylate (E-MA-GMA), was added to the m-PE/PET blends during the processing using TSE and ERE. It was observed that the improvement of the tensile property by adding the compatibilizer is marginal for the m-PE/PET blends processed using ERE, which indirectly proves the high effectiveness of the elongational flow field on the enhancement of the dispersion and mixing of PET in the m-PE matrix and the interface interaction.},

The compatibilizers involved an unfunctionalized SEBS and two functionalized grades containing either maleic anhydride (SEBS-g-MAH) or glycidyl methacrylate (SEBS-g-GMA) grafted to the midblock. The effects of the compatibilizers were evaluated by studies on morphology and mechanical, thermal and rheological properties of the blends. The additon of 5 wt \% of a SEBS copolymer was found to stabilize the blend morphology and to improve the impact strength. The effect was, however, far more pronounced with the functionalized copolymers. Particularly high toughness combined with rather high stiffness was achieved with SEBS-g-GMA for the PET-rich composition. Addition of the functionalized SEBS copolymers resulted in a finer dispersion of the minor phase and clearly improved interfacial adhesion. Shifts in the glass transition temperature of the PET phase and increase in the melt viscosity of the compatibilized blends indicated enhanced interactions between the discrete PET and PP phases induced by the functionalized compatibilizer, in particular SEBS-g-GMA. \textcopyright{} 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

  abstract = {The rapid transition of the Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) Additive Manufacturing (AM) process from small scale prototype models to large scale polymer deposition has been driven, in part, by the addition of short carbon fibers to the polymer feedstock. The addition of short carbon fibers improves both the mechanical and thermal properties of the printed beads. The improvements to the anisotropic mechanical and thermal properties of the polymer feedstock are dependent on the spatially varying orientation of short carbon fibers which is itself a function of the velocity gradients in the flow field throughout the nozzle and in the extrudate during deposition flow. This paper presents a computational approach for simulating the deposition flow that occurs in the Large Area Additive Manufacturing (LAAM) process and the effects on the final short fiber orientation state in the deposited polymer bead and the resulting bead mechanical and thermal properties. The finite element method is used to evaluate Stokes flow for a two-dimensional planar flow field within a Strangpresse Model 19 LAAM polymer deposition nozzle. A shape optimization method is employed to compute the shape of the polymer melt flow free surface below the nozzle exit as the bead is deposited on a moving print platform. Three nozzle configurations are considered in this study. Fiber orientation tensors are calculated throughout the fluid domain using the Folgar-Tucker fiber interaction model. The effective bulk mechanical properties, specifically the longitudinal and transverse moduli, and the coefficient of thermal expansion, are also calculated for the deposited bead based on the spatially varying fiber orientation tensors. Fiber orientation is found to be highly aligned along the deposition direction of the resulting bead and the computed properties through the thickness of the bead are found to be affected by nozzle height during deposition.},

  abstract = {The common layer-by-layer deposition of regular, 3-axis 3D printing simplifies both the fabrication process and the 3D printer's mechanical design. However, the resulting 3D printed objects have some unfavourable characteristics including visible layers, uneven structural strength and support material. To overcome these, researchers have employed robotic arms and multi-axis CNCs to deposit materials in conformal layers. Conformal deposition improves the quality of the 3D printed parts through support-less printing and curved layer deposition. However, such multi-axis 3D printing is inaccessible to many individuals due to high costs and technical complexities. Furthermore, the limited GUI support for conformal slicers creates an additional barrier for users. To open multi-axis 3D printing up to more makers and researchers, we present a cheap and accessible way to upgrade a regular 3D printer to 5 axes. We have also developed a GUI-based conformal slicer, integrated within a popular CAD package. Together, these deliver an accessible workflow for designing, simulating and creating conformally-printed 3D models.},

The purpose of this study is to develop composite material parts manufactured from recycled thermoplastics and natural fibres, in this case, wood residues. Additive manufacturing (fused deposition modelling) will be accomplished using a robot combined with extrusion unit. The objective is to access the influence of the main manufacturing parameters, such as temperature, distance between layers or deposition speed, on the final part characteristics, especially dimensional accuracy.

The parametric designs allow for adaptation to other core components and can be custom fit specifically to fire-fighter equipment, including their suspenders. The open source PAPR has controllable air flow and its design enables breathing even if the fan is disconnected or if the battery dies.

  abstract = {The main aim of this work was to 3D print metformin HCl\textendash loaded PVA (ML-PVA) tablets by fused deposition modeling. A modified solvent diffusion approach was used to improve drug loading. PVA filaments were placed in metformin HCl solution in ethanol containing low water content (10\%(v/v)) to enhance the drug's solubility. The physicochemical properties of ML-PVA filaments were characterized before and after printing. Lastly, ML-PVA filaments were printed into channeled tablet designs to increase their surface area available for dissolution. The loading of metformin HCl onto PVA filament has significantly increased from 0.08\,{$\pm$}\,0.02\% in metformin HCl solution in absolute ethanol to 1.40\,{$\pm$}\,0.02\% in ethanol-water (9:1). The IR spectra of PVA filament soaked in ethanol-water depicted higher peak intensity at 1138~cm-1, indicating higher degree of crystallinity. Thermal analysis of the soaked PVA filaments showed higher melting enthalpies yet lower melting temperature (Tm) compared to unprocessed PVA. ML-PVA filaments were successfully printed into round-channeled tablets (10\% infill) with higher surface area and area/volume ratios compared with the solid ones. The inclusion of channels in the tablet design modified their printing pattern causing an unexpected increase in their mass. The dissolution profiles of ML-PVA tablets were mainly dependent on their area/mass ratios. Our results show a simple approach to increase metformin HCl loading onto PVA and reveal the significance of tablet design, infill percentage, and printing pattern as they dictate the area, volume, and the mass of the tablet which impact its dissolution rate.},

The idea of incorporating PP of different molecular weights evolved from the intention of simultaneously recycling the PET bottles together with the PP-based bottle caps, which are often of low molecular weight (Mw). Three grades of PP with known molecular weights were blended with RPET at various loadings of compatibilizers. Morphological analyses suggest that the dispersion of the PP particles was more homogeneous, and the average particle size was smaller when low Mw PP was incorporated. This indicates that the interaction between the compatibilizer and PP particles was more intense with the presence of a large number but shorter PP molecular chains. Moreover, specimens containing low Mw PP were found to remain homogeneous regardless of compatibilizer and PP content in the RPET/PP blends. The homogeneity of the blends significantly affected their mechanical performance as well. Higher stiffness, yield strength, deformability, and toughness were observed when low Mw PP was incorporated, regardless of PP and compatibilizer loadings. \textcopyright{} 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The idea of blending RPET with PP sprouted from the intention of recycling PET bottles together with their PP-based caps. Therefore, preliminary blending of RPET with neat PP (RPET/PP) was performed at various PP and compatibilizer contents. Morphological analyses on the extruded pellets of uncompatibilized blends indicate that the PP particle size and state of dispersion at skin and core regions were vastly different. The particles at the skin were at least 10 times smaller than that at the core although the size distribution was very wide. With the incorporation of just 5 phr of compatibilizer, the particles at the core region became significantly smaller and appeared to emulate that of the skin region. Furthermore, the overall homogeneity of the blends was vastly improved irrespective of PP content in the blend. The reduction in particle size and improved homogeneity inherently reduced stress concentration points and enhanced the mechanical performance of the blends. More importantly, the incorporation of PP into RPET significantly increased the degradation temperature of the blends, provided the dispersion of PP phase in RPET was excellent. \textcopyright{} 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

PET/PP/GNP composites 0\textendash 5 phr were prepared and characterized using field emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy analysis. The morphological studies revealed a homogenous dispersion of GNPs in PET/PP blends up to 3 phr loading after which agglomeration occurred. Flexural strength was enhanced by 80\% at 3 phr GNPs loading which was the highest value obtained. Interestingly, the highest value for the impact strength was also recorded at 3 phr loading. The thermal stability of the composites were generally improved at all filler loading with the highest at 3 phr. From the overall results, it is clear that the optimum concentration of GNPs in the PET/PP/GNP system in terms of both mechanical and thermal properties was 3 phr loading.

The filler concentration was varied between 0 -5.98~wt percent (\%) (0\textendash 7~phr). The resulting nanocomposites were characterized in terms of flame retardancy, thermal conductivity, thermal behavior, morphology and structure. Cone calorimeter analysis, limiting oxygen index (LOI) and UL94 flame rating tests revealed that addition of GNPs to PET/PP improved the flame retardancy of PET/PP/GNP nanocomposites significantly. Cone calorimeter data show a significant reduction of peak heat release rate (PHRR), mass loss rate and delayed time to ignition (TTI) due to addition of GNPs to PET/PP blend. As much as 37\% reduction in PHRR and 32\% increase in TTI were observed for the maximum GNP loading. Enhancements of flammability properties were attributed to the development of compact, dense, uniform char layers on the surface of nanocomposites. The effective thermal conductivity was found to vary linearly with GNP loading which was attributed to the formation of effective interconnected heat conduction bridges formed by the GNPs. It was found that the effective thermal conductivity of the nanocomposites was increased by about 80\%, i.e. from 1.2~W/m.K for the unreinforced PET/PP blend to 1.9~W/m~K for the 5.98~wt\% (7~phr) reinforced PET/PP/GNP nanocomposites. Differential scanning calorimetry results indicated that the addition of GNPs increased crystallization temperatures but decreased degree of crystallinity of PET/PP/GNP nanocomposites. However; the melting points remained essentially unaffected. Transmission electron microscopy and field emission scanning electron microscopy showed uniform dispersion of GNPs in the matrix with the formation of interconnected GNP sheets at 3~phr.

  abstract = {Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene (PP) are incompatible thermoplastics because of differences in chemical structure and polarity, hence their blends possess inferior mechanical and thermal properties. Compatibilization with a suitable block/graft copolymer is one way to improve the mechanical and thermal properties of the PET/PP blend. In this study, the toughness, dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of PET/PP blends were investigated as a function of different content of styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene-g-maleic anhydride (SEBS-g-MAH) compatibilizer. PET, PP, and SEBS-g-MAH were melt-blended in a single step using the counter rotating twin screw extruder with compatibilizer concentrations of 0, 5, 10, and 15 phr, respectively. The impact strength of compatibilized blend with 10 phr SEBS-g-MAH increased by 300\% compared to the uncompatibilized blend. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) micrographs show that the addition of 10 phr SEBS-g-MAH compatibilizer into the PET/PP blends decreased the particle size of the dispersed PP phase to the minimum level. The improvement of the storage modulus and the decrease in the glass transition temperature of the PET phase indicated an interaction among the blend components. Thermal stability of the PET/PP blends was significantly improved because of the addition of SEBS-g-MAH. J. VINYL ADDIT.

The synthesized composites were characterized after compounding using a twin-screw extruder and injection-molding machine. The tensile, flexural and impact strengths values peaked at 2 parts per hundred resin (phr). Thermogravimetric analysis showed a marked improvement in thermal stability of the fabricated composites. A gradual increase in T50 and Tmax with increasing HNTs content was observed. The limiting oxygen index revealed a linear relationship with HNTs content. Transmission electron microscopy images showed uniform dispersion of nanotubes at lower HNTs content and agglomerated structures were formed at higher HNTs content due to inter-tubular interactions both in face-to-face or face-to-edge manner. The improvements in thermal stability and flammability are attributed to these interactions. Due to improved mechanical properties and flammability, the fabricated composites have potential applications in automotive industries. POLYM.

In the present work, different compositions of PP/PET blends were prepared and compatibilized by various contents of SEBS-g-MAH. The compatibilizing efficiency was examined using macro- (tensile and impact strength) and micro-mechanical testing (microhardness measurement), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS), and melt flow index (MFI) determinations. The results show that the addition of SEBS-g-MAH improves the processability and the toughness of these blends. The changes in the melting enthalpies ({$\Delta$}Hm) of the PP and PET components and the decrease of MFI values in the compatibilized blends indicated enhanced interactions between the discrete PET and PP phases induced by the functional compatibilizer. The DSC crystallinity of each component depended on the blend composition, and was slightly influenced by the presence of the compatibilizer. In the samples subjected to compression molding, the WAXS crystallinity of PP component slightly decreased in the presence of increasing amounts of compatibilizer.},

Aims We tried to find the current role, availability and need of ventilators in the COVID-19 pandemic and the role of applied innovative technologies is assessed. Methods We have done a comprehensive review of the literature using suitable keywords on the search engines of PubMed, SCOPUS, Google Scholar and Research Gate in the second week of April 2020. Results We found in our review that there is an acute shortage of the ventilators and the manpower to operate these sophisticated machines. There is significant deficiency in the production and supply chain of the ventilators. Many of the seriously ill patients who require hospitalization may need ventilator support. Non-invasive ventilation is not recommended in these patients. Conclusion As the respiratory illness due to COVID-19 pandemic spreads worldwide, health care systems are facing the tough challenges of acquiring ventilators to support patients. All steps involved in the supply chain management of ventilators are being escalated to produce more ventilators for the coronavirus frontline. Innovative applications of Additive medicine like 3-D printer technology may play key role in delivering sufficient ventilators.},

With the addition of maleic anhydride olefin grafted copolymer as a compatibilizing agent, however, ternary blends can be obtained which display good processability, mechanical, and optical properties. The mechanical properties of these blends have been found to be specifically dependent upon composition as well as morphological phase characteristics. Variation of these factors can result in four different levels of impact and elongation to break properties. The crystallization kinetics of the PET component in the ternary blends were studied under dynamic cooling and isothermal conditions.

The non-surgical correction of this deformity is an unsolved challenging problem in the medical domain and it becomes interesting due to the increasing number of such patients. The purpose of this paper is to build a biomodel of this historical foot deformity in newborn babies and hence an attempt to develop a corrective procedure using rapid prototyping (RP). Design/methodology/approach \textendash{} Biomodeling is a new technology that allows medical scan data sets to generate solid plastic replicas of anatomical structures. The medical scan data sets of live club foot baby patients were acquired and after image processing, biomodels of four live unilateral club foot baby patients are developed in a fused deposition modeling RP system. Findings \textendash{} The paper shows the location and position of abnormal bones and abnormal tarsal joints and is useful for management of club foot deformity in newborn babies. On visual study, it is observed that the talus is underdeveloped, talar neck is shorter and deviated in the medial and planter direction. Research limitations/implications \textendash{} The major outcome of this paper is the detailed geometrical visualization of talus bone of club foot and normal foot that assists in diagnosis and better treatment of CTEV. In future, the developed biomodels of club foot help to develop a corrective device that assists in bringing the club to normal foot geometrys. Practical implications \textendash{} These developed biomodels of club foot help in deciding the best corrective procedure for surgeons. The geometrical comparison between normal and club foot helps in developing a non-surgical corrective procedure of this historical foot deformity. A 3D representation of talus bone provides an opportunity to view talus and analyse the ankle joint geometry that develops a favorable condition for diagnosis and treatment of this deformity. Originality/value \textendash{} The first time developed biomodels of clubfeet helps orthopaedic surgeons in preoperative surgical planning and consequently in carrying out biomechanical studies of club foot. The presented research plays a major role in planning a non-surgical corrective procedure of this historical deformity. It also provides a platform for finite element analysis of club foot.}

  abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) was developed initially as a technique for rapid prototyping, to visualize, test and authenticate a design, before end-user production of the design. In recent years, Additive Manufacturing (AM) technique Fused Deposition modeling (FDM), has developed to become a rapid manufacturing technique because of the ability to produce complex parts layer-by-layer in lesser production cycle time than as compared to conventional machining processes. FDM also offers the advantage of the lowest cost because of no tooling requirements. Despite these advantages, building parts by utilizing FDM for end-use is still a demanding endeavor. This is because FDM has multiple processing parameters, which affect the part quality, mechanical properties, build time and dimensional accuracy. These FDM processing parameters include air gap, build orientation, infill percentage, raster angle, layer thickness, etc. Depending upon the application, for which the part is manufactured, careful selection of these process parameters needs to be done. For a specific output requirement, some of the process parameters are significant than the rest, these significant process parameters need to be identified and optimized. Due to this, researchers have explored and utilized various experimental or statistical Design of Experiment (DOE) techniques for optimizing the FDM process parameters to improve the mechanical properties or part quality or both. Some of these DOE techniques include the Taguchi method, Genetic algorithm (GA), gray relational, Response surface method (RSM), fractional factorial, Artificial Neural networks (ANN), Fuzzy logic, ANOVA, etc. This article aims at reviewing the current research on the statistical and experimental design techniques for different applications or output responses such as enhancing mechanical properties, build time, part quality, etc.},

For comparison, the conventional PET/HDPE blends were also obtained using the same processing operation but without hot stretching. The morphological observation indicated that slit die extrusion and hot stretching successfully made the dispersed PET phase deform in situ into well-defined microfibrils. The average diameter of the microfibrils increased with the processing cycles. The rheological properties obtained from the parallel-plate dynamic rheometer suggested that the microfibrillar blends have higher viscosity and viscoelastic moduli (storage and loss moduli) as well as better flow stability than the conventional PET/HDPE blend. More importantly, with the increase in the processing cycles, an increase in yield strength and unchanged tensile modulus were observed for in situ microfibrillar blends, while a decrease in these properties for conventional blend, indicating that the in situ microfibrillar PET/HDPE blends have promising recycling potential.},

A rapid and sensitive Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrophotometric method was developed for determination of possible impurities in piracetam. The results showed that the method was effective for the simultaneous determination of PAc in piracetam by FTIR spectrophotometry and may be a real alternative to HPLC. The apparent spectral resolution was first enhanced by using the Fourier self-deconvolution (FSD) method and the profiles were then fully deconvoluted by using a curve fitting procedure. FSD method followed by curve fitting allowed to evaluate quantitatively the areas under the pyrrolidine acetic acid peaks. Mixtures of known composition were used as standards to minimise errors due to the presence of both compounds in the same mixture. The detection limit of pyrrolidine acetic acid was estimated to be 0.1\% with respect to piracetam.},

Current work aims at effective recycling of waste PET from soft drink bottles by glycolysis method and thereby utilization of the recycled product for coating application. In the investigation, we report neopentyl glycol (NPG), which till date is not studied much for chemical recycling of PET, as an effective diol for glycolysis reaction. NPG was used in a molar ratio of 1:6 (PET:NPG) and the glycolysis reaction was carried out at 200\textendash 220\textdegree C in presence of 0.5\% zinc acetate as a trans-esterification catalyst. The progress of glycolysis reaction was studied by means of molecular weight of residual PET and hydroxyl value of the glycolyzed oligomer. The glycolyzed oligomer was also characterized using gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to study its molecular weight distribution and the thermal characteristics respectively. The glycolyzed monomeric product was purified and characterized by conventional method of hydroxyl and saponification number, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Proton NMR (1H NMR) spectroscopy, DSC, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and gas chromatography\textendash mass spectroscopy (GC\textendash MS). Further polyester (PE) polyol was successfully synthesized by polyesterification of glycolyzed monomeric product, adipic acid, isophthalic acid and trimethylol propane. Polyurethane coatings were prepared from the polyester polyol and different commercial polyisocyanate curing agents and applied on mild steel panels. The coated films were evaluated for their optical, mechanical and chemical properties. Thermal properties of coatings were investigated by DSC and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA).},

Each dispersed phase (LCP or rPET) was melt blended with high density polyethylene (PE) by using extrusion process. The rheological behavior, morphology, and the thermal stability of LCP/PE and rPET/PE blends containing various dispersed phase contents were investigated. All blends and LCP exhibited shear thinning behavior, whereas Newtonian fluid behavior was observed for rPET. The incorporation of LCP or rPET into PE significantly improved the processability. A potential of rPET as a processing lubricant by bringing down the melt viscosity of the blend system was as good as LCP. The elongated LCP domains were clearly observed in as-extruded strand. Although the viscosity ratio of the rPET/PE system was lower than that of the LCP/PE blend system, most rPET domains appeared as small droplets. An addition of LCP and rPET into the PE matrix improved the thermal resistance significantly in air but not in nitrogen. The obtained results suggested the high potential of rPET as a processing aid and good thermally resistant material similar to LCP. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The PE-LCP and PE-rPET composites were prepared as fiber using hot drawing process. The effects of draw ratios and compatibilizer (styrene-ethylene butylene-styrene-grafted maleic anhydride, SEBS-g-MA) loading on morphology, tensile properties, thermal stability and dynamic mechanical characteristics of the LCP- and rPET-composite systems were studied. In as-spun samples containing compatibilizer, the fibrillation of LCP domains was observed whereas rPET domains appeared as droplets. After drawing, good fibrillation of LCP and rPET domains is remarkably observed especially in the composite fibers with compatibilizer loading. The mechanical properties of the composite fibers were strongly depended on the fibrillation of the dispersed phases which directly related the levels of draw ratio and compatibilizer loading. The mechanical properties enhanced by SEBS-g-MA were more pronounced in the rPET than LCP systems. The presence of rPET in the composite fibers alone or with the compatibilizer clearly improved the thermal resistance of PE whereas no significant change in thermal stability for the LCP-containing composite fibers with and without compatibilizer loading. The results from dynamic mechanical analysis revealed that an improvement in dynamic mechanical properties of the composite fibers could be achieved by drawing with optimum draw ratio together with optimum compatibilizer dosage. All obtained results suggested the high potential of rPET minor blend-component as a good reinforcing and thermal resistant materials for the thermoplastic composite fiber, in replacing the more expensive LCP.},

The neat PE and its composites reinforced with LCP and rPET microfibrils under the compatibilizing promotion of 5 wt\% styrene-(ethylene butylene)-styrene-grafted maleic anhydride (SEBS-g-MA) compatibilizer, were prepared as fibers using a hot drawing process. Cross-ply laminates of the neat PE and the compatibilized composite fibers were then prepared using a film stacking method. The tensile, flexural and impact performances of each laminate system were examined and compared. Under tensile loading, no significant differences in the initial part of the stress-strain curves, and hence comparable tensile modulus ({$\approx$}4 GPa) among all laminates, were observed. A difference was only seen in the final part of the curves. For flexural properties, the flexural moduli of the compatibilized LCP- and rPET-composite laminates were nearly the same ({$\approx$}3 GPa). At high flexural strains (\&gt;1\%), the different stress-strain behaviors of the laminates were clearly observed. Interestingly, the compatibilized rPET-composite laminate showed much better impact-resistance compared with PE- and compatibilized LCP-laminates. The results demonstrated a high potential for use of the rPET-composite fiber laminate in impact-resistant applications.},

A 6-axis robotic arm, repurposed as an integrated 3D printing, milling and sculpting platform, enables shifting between fabrication modes and across scales using different end effectors. Promoting an integrated approach to robotic fabrication, novel combination processes are demonstrated including 3D printing and milling fabrication composites. In addition, novel robotic fabrication processes are developed and evaluated, such as multi-axis plastic 3D printing, direct recycling 3D printing, and embedded printing. The benefits and limitations of the Compound Fabrication approach and its experimental platform are reviewed and discussed. Finally, contemplation regarding the future of multi-functional robotic fabrication is offered, in the context of the experiments reviewed and demonstrated in this paper.},

  abstract = {The plastic waste dilemma has gained international attention because of increased public awareness and the rise of waste import bans. Sorting and recycling technologies that deal with plastic waste streams exist but face challenges in highly dense urbanized regions such as Singapore because of high space requirements. Multiple small-scale plastic sorting and recycling facilities that are distributed closer to points of waste generation offer the possibility of increasing the recovery of plastic-waste streams in urbanized settings. To holistically quantify the environmental performance of this type of system, a life cycle assessment (LCA) is conducted to compare five different scenarios of distributed and centralized sorting and recycling of plastic bottles and takeaway containers in Singapore. A hybrid simulation model is used to simulate the complex dynamics of waste-processing systems which involves waste generation, collection scheduling, sorting, recycling, and disposal of residual materials. The results of the LCA showed that the life cycle environmental impacts to climate change, water depletion, and terrestrial ecotoxicity of the distributed scenarios were higher than the centralized scenarios by 7\textendash 30\% depending on the impact category. Although the distributed scenarios had lower total travel distances, their reliance on commercial vans led to their higher environmental impacts than the centralized scenarios. The findings of this study provide motivation for future research in applying hybrid simulation models in LCAs of waste-to-resource exchange networks. The data used to carry out the hybrid simulations and the LCA are provided as Supporting Information.

Two types of compatibilizer namely, PP-g-MA {$<$}MA= maleic anhydtide{$>$} and Elvaloy PTW, an n-butyl acrylate glycidyl methacrylate ethylene terpolymers, were incorporated at different levels to the PET/PP blend system. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the dispersed particle sizes were smaller in PET-rich blends than PP-rich blends. With increasing compatibilizer level, the refinement of morphology was observed in both the systems. However, the blends compatibilized with PTW showed a more refined (smaller) particle size, and at high PTW content (10 wt\%), the morphology changed towards monophasic. The significant changes in morphology were attributed to the highly reactive nature of PTW. Investigation of rheological properties revealed that the viscosity of the PET/PP blends followed typical trends based on mixing rule, which calculates the properties of blends based on a linear average. Incorporation of PP-g-MA into the blends resulted in a negative deviation in the viscosity of the system with respect to that of the neat blend. With increasing PP-g-MA level, the deviation became more pronounced. Although incorporation of the compatibilizer into the PET/PP blends refined the morphology, it led to a drastic drop of viscosity, which could be attributed to inherently lower molecular weight of the compatibilizer. In the case of the blends compatibilized by PTW, a strong positive deviation in rheological properties was observed that confirmed the stronger interaction between the blend components due to reactive compatibilization process, which led to the more refined morphology in this series of blends.

However, the blends compatibilized with PTW showed a more refined (smaller) particle size, and at high PTW content (10 wt\%), the morphology changed towards monophasic. The significant changes in morphology were attributed to the highly reactive nature of PTW. Investigation of rheological properties revealed that the viscosity of the PET/PP blends followed typical trends based on mixing rule, which calculates the properties of blends based on a linear average. Incorporation of PP-g-MA into the blends resulted in a negative deviation in the viscosity of the system with respect to that of the neat blend. With increasing PP-g-MA level, the deviation became more pronounced. Although incorporation of the compatibilizer into the PET/PP blends refined the morphology, it led to a drastic drop of viscosity, which could be attributed to inherently lower molecular weight of the compatibilizer. In the case of the blends compatibilized by PTW, a strong positive deviation in rheological properties was observed that confirmed the stronger interaction between the blend components due to reactive compatibilization process, which led to the more refined morphology in this series of blends.

  abstract = {A correlation between rheology and morphology of polypropylene/poly(trimethylene terephthalate) blend nanocomposites was addressed. Organoclay particles were preferentially localized either at the interface or inside the polyester phase depending upon affinity the level and exerted compatibilizing role by making a finer morphology. The functional compatibilizer was found to be highly efficient in giving rise to an enhanced interfacial adhesion and uniform morphology. The compatibilizer also expanded the clay gallery space by increasing its interlayer distance. Rheological measurements showed that nanoclay and compatibilizer contribute to the complex viscosity of the system considerably. Also, an upturn was detected at low angular frequencies ascribed to a secondary structure formation. Similar behavior was also found when storage shear modulus was studied, where at low frequencies a terminal plateau of yield stress character appeared that was connected with some intermolecular networks. This was further supported via relaxation time spectra wherein additional peaks due to interface emerged at low frequencies. \textcopyright{} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym. Sci., 2013},

We achieve this by feeding thermoplastic pellets into a stand-alone single screw system that melts and pushes the material through a flexible heated hose to the print head. The material is finally deposited through the print head onto the print bed to construct the 3D object. This heated hose decouples the large mass extruder from an FDM print head which can then move with high speed and precision. The result is a very simple 3D printing tool that can take raw input pellets or even recycled thermoplastic scrap, and directly print parts without the need to produce an intermediate, high-quality filament. This technique has been successfully used for pellets of both soft and hard thermoplastics. Using pellets of styrene\textendash ethylene\textendash butylene\textendash styrene, airtight pneumatic soft robotic actuators have been printed in a single process. In theory, this technique should be suitable for any thermoplastic material regardless of their flexibility, stretchability, and hardness which is not possible with currently available commercial FDM systems.},

The addition of PEAA improves the mechanical properties such as flexural yield strain and impact strength when HDPE forms matrix phase. On the other hand, when the PET is the matrix, no significant improvement of mechanical properties is observed, suggesting that the crystallization rate can be an important factor in the blend composed of two crystalline components. The addition of PEAA also affects morphological features such as reducing the size of the dispersed phase and making the interface obscure indicating the role of PEAA as a reactive compatibilizer. The crystallinity of PET and HDPE is slightly reduced by the addition of PEAA. The content of acrylic acid (AA) in PEAA also has an effect on mechanical properties and morphology, suggesting the added PEAA goes to the HDPE phase as well as the interface between PET and HDPE.},

High-density polyethylene grafted with the blocked isocyanate group (HDPE-g-BHI) was used as a reactive compatibilizer for an immiscible high-density polyethylene/poly(ethylene terephthalate) (HDPE/PET) blend. A possible reactive compatibilization mechanism is that regenerated isocyanate groups of HDPE functionalized by BHI react with the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups of PET during melt blending. The HDPE-g-BHI/PET blend showed the smaller size of a dispersed phase compared to the HDPE/PET blend, indicating improved compatibility between HDPE and PET. This increased compatibility was due to the formation of an in situ graft copolymer, which was confirmed by dynamic mechanical analysis. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis represented that there were few changes in the crystallinity for the continuous PET phase of the HDPE-g-BHI/PET blends, compared with those of the HDPE/PET blends at the same composition. Tensile strengths and elongations at the break of the HDPE-g-BHI/PET blends were greater than those of the HDPE/PET blends. \textcopyright{} 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

More than a billion people with no access to electricity still have access to some imported higher-technologies; however, these often lack customization and often appropriateness for their community. Open source appropriate tech\-nology (OSAT) can over\-come this challenge, but one of the key impediments to the more rapid development and distri\-bution of OSAT is the lack of means of production beyond a specific technical complexity. This study designs and demonstrates the technical viability of two open-source mobile digital manufacturing facilities powered with solar photovoltaics, and capable of printing customizable OSAT in any com\-munity with access to sunlight. The first, designed for com\-munity use, such as in schools or maker\-spaces, is semi-mobile and capable of nearly continuous 3-D printing using RepRap technology, while also powering multiple computers. The second design, which can be completely packed into a standard suitcase, allows for specialist travel from community to community to provide the ability to custom manufacture OSAT as needed, anywhere. These designs not only bring the possibility of complex manufacturing and replacement part fabrication to isolated rural communities lacking access to the electric grid, but they also offer the opportunity to leap-frog the entire conventional manufacturing supply chain, while radically reducing both the cost and the environmental impact of products for developing communities.},

A necessary consequence of this method is a pronounced mechanical anisotropy of the product; the interface between the filaments is weaker compared to the filament itself. The strength of this interface is governed by the reptation theory which postulates a more efficient interpenetration of polymeric surfaces with decreasing polymer viscosity. This relationship was utilized in this work to modify a polycarbonate-acrylonitrile butadiene styrene polymer blend to produce FFF work pieces with less mechanical anisotropy, independent of printer settings. The tensile strength ratio of the printed interface to bulk tensile strength could be increased from 41\% to 95\%. Though the absolute bulk tensile strength decreases slightly, this method presents an easy and effective way to address the mechanical problems inherent in the FFF-method.},

The feasibility to decentralize the recycling of e-waste needs to be analyzed, considering the different characteristics of each municipality. We propose a distributed recycling system for obsolete alkaline batteries using microwave apparatus as a small-scale recycling technology. Firstly, the reactivity of obsolete alkaline batteries with microwave irradiation was empirically examined. In lab-based experiments, pyrometallurgical microwave-based heating successfully separated a mixed sample of Mn3O4 and ZnO contained in obsolete alkaline batteries and recovered MnO and Zn separately, achieving a recovery rate of 97\% under an ambient atmosphere. It was also found that the recovery rate of zinc obtained by microwave-based heating is 1.5-fold that using conventional electric furnace-based heating, with less than half of the heating time required. The experimental results were then used to analytically determine the energy efficiency of the distributed recycling system for the treatment of obsolete alkaline batteries with microwave apparatus compared with the centralized recycling system. In an analytical study which considered the characteristics of 1710 municipalities in Japan, it was found that an annual energy and greenhouse gas reduction of 26,500 GJ and 1.54 Gg-CO2eq, respectively, can be achieved at the national level by creating a well-balanced harmony between the centralized and distributed systems. The method applied in this study to determine the effectiveness based on population and intercity transport distance can be readily implemented in any city for the adoption of a distributed recycling system.},

We have examined the effect of small additions of diblock copolymers, random copolymers and reactive end-functional chains in to interfaces between polystyrene and other glassy polymers on the interfacial fracture toughness. By labelling portions of the polymer additive with deuterium, we can use forward-recoil spectrometry on the fracture surfaces to determine (1) the areal chain density, {$\Sigma$}, of the additive at the interface and (2) the mechanism of interface failure. We outline how the important failure mechanisms, chain pull-out, crazing and chain scission, depend on {$\Sigma$} and the architecture of the polymer additive and discuss strategies for maximizing the interfacial fracture toughness.},

To achieve this goal, test objects were printed using four different printing strategies by an industrial robotic arm and a pellet-fed screw extruder. The strategies tested in this study are regular 3-axis deposition with planar layers, 5-axis deposition with planar layers, 3-axis deposition with nonplanar layers, and 5-axis deposition with nonplanar layers. Custom scripts for nonplanar slicing and for tilt control during multiaxis printing were developed to achieve these prints and are explained in this study. The results were evaluated using 3D scanning and mechanical testing, and surface accuracy, surface roughness, and layer adhesion strength were compared. The most important findings are (1) 5-axis motion alone does not improve the results of the printing; (2) while nonplanar printing can improve surface quality, its usability is geometry dependent; and (3) multi-axis nonplanar printing, even with partial tilt (30\textdegree ) can expand printability with enhanced quality to at least 75\textdegree{} overhang angle. The future potential of these methods and the requirements to achieve them are discussed.},

  author = {Kreiger, Megan and Pearce, Joshua M},
  abstract = {Although additive layer manufacturing is well established for rapid prototyping the low throughput and historic costs have prevented mass-scale adoption. The recent development of the RepRap, an open source self-replicating rapid prototyper, has made low-cost 3-D printers readily available to the public at reasonable prices ({$<\$$}1,000). The RepRap (Prusa Mendell variant) currently prints 3-D objects in a 200x200x140 square millimeters build envelope from acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polylactic acid (PLA). ABS and PLA are both thermoplastics that can be injection-molded, each with their own benefits, as ABS is rigid and durable, while PLA is plant-based and can be recycled and composted. The melting temperature of ABS and PLA enable use in low-cost 3-D printers, as these temperature are low enough to use in melt extrusion in the home, while high enough for prints to retain their shape at average use temperatures. Using 3-D printers to manufacture provides the ability to both change the fill composition by printing voids and fabricate shapes that are impossible to make using tradition methods like injection molding. This allows more complicated shapes to be created while using less material, which could reduce environmental impact. As the open source 3-D printers continue to evolve and improve in both cost and performance, the potential for economically-viable distributed manufacturing of products increases. Thus, products and components could be customized and printed on-site by individual consumers as needed, reversing the historical trend towards centrally mass-manufactured and shipped products. Distributed manufacturing reduces embodied transportation energy from the distribution of conventional centralized manufacturing, but questions remain concerning the potential for increases in the overall embodied energy of the manufacturing due to reduction in scale. In order to quantify the environmental impact of distributed manufacturing using 3-D printers, a life cycle analysis was performed on a plastic juicer. The energy consumed and emissions produced from conventional large-scale production overseas are compared to experimental measurements on a RepRap producing identical products with ABS and PLA. The results of this LCA are discussed in relation to the environmental impact of distributed manufacturing with 3-D printers and polymer selection for 3-D printing to reduce this impact. The results of this study show that distributed manufacturing uses less energy than conventional manufacturing due to the RepRap's unique ability to reduce fill composition. Distributed manufacturing also has less emissions than conventional manufacturing when using PLA and when using ABS with solar photovoltaic power. The results of this study indicate that opensource additive layer distributed manufacturing is both technically viable and beneficial from an ecological perspective.},

  abstract = {The growth of desktop 3-D printers is driving an interest in recycled 3-D printer filament to reduce costs of distributed production. Life cycle analysis studies were performed on the recycling of high density polyethylene into filament suitable for additive layer manufacturing with 3-D printers. The conventional centralized recycling system for high population density and low population density rural locations was compared to the proposed in home, distributed recycling system. This system would involve shredding and then producing filament with an open-source plastic extruder from post-consumer plastics and then printing the extruded filament into usable, value-added parts and products with 3-D printers such as the open-source self replicating rapid prototyper, or RepRap. The embodied energy and carbon dioxide emissions were calculated for high density polyethylene recycling using SimaPro 7.2 and the database EcoInvent v2.0. The results showed that distributed recycling uses less embodied energy than the best-case scenario used for centralized recycling. For centralized recycling in a low-density population case study involving substantial embodied energy use for transportation and collection these savings for distributed recycling were found to extend to over 80\%. If the distributed process is applied to the U.S. high density polyethylene currently recycled, more than 100 million MJ of energy could be conserved per annum along with the concomitant significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. It is concluded that with the open-source 3-D printing network expanding rapidly the potential for widespread adoption of in-home recycling of post-consumer plastic represents a novel path to a future of distributed manufacturing appropriate for both the developed and developing world with lower environmental impacts than the current system.},

Peroxide initiators 2,5-bis(tert-butylperoxy)-2,5-dimethylhexane (L101) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and poly(styrene-b-ethylene-b-butylene-b-styrene) grafted with maleic anhydride (SEBS-g-MAH) were used for the reactive processing of polymer blend under optimized conditions (concentration, reaction temperature, and time). The compatibilization was evidenced by ``online'' monitoring of the melt viscosity during reactive processing of polymer blend and examined by melt volume rate, oscillatory rheology, mechanical testing, and scanning electron microscopy. The effect of selected peroxides on the type of radical reaction was also evidenced for individual thermoplastics. Both L101 and hydrogen peroxide modify the melt viscosity with different effectivity due to different miscibility, decomposition mechanism, and limited reactivity of individual thermoplastics toward primary radicals. Therefore, the efficiency of compatibilization is limited. On the other hand, SEBS-g-MAH acts is an ``universal'' and effective reactive compatibilizer for multicomponent polymeric blend due to combination of covalent and non-covalent interactions with blended thermoplastics, resulting in the improvement of mechanical properties and morphology of polymer blend.},

Using this route, preceramic polymers can be shaped in the polymer state and then pyrolyzed to produce different types of ceramics. Cellular ceramics can be manufactured using this technique. Herein, the novel fabrication of cellular ceramics with a two-step process using PDCs is reported. First cellular structures are 3D printed with fused filament fabrication (FFF) using thermoplastic polyurethane and impregnated with preceramic polymer polysilazane. Second, pyrolysis of the impregnated structure produces a self-similar ceramic cellular structure. The impact of 1) catalysts, 2) curing environment, and 3) pyrolysis sequence optimization to form cellular ceramics with fully dense SiOC(N) struts are systemically evaluated. The resultant custom ceramic components can tolerate operating temperatures of 1500 \textdegree C and can be manufactured for less than 5\% of the cost of competing methods. The ceramic material is shown to be biocompatible and promotes fast cell adhesion. Finally, early-stage cell activation on the SiOC(N) structure is shown to be tunable by adjusting the porosity with this 3D printing to mimic the bone tissue geometry for bone regeneration.},

  abstract = {A promising method for obtaining ceramic components with additive manufacturing (AM) is to use a two-step process of first printing the artifact in polymer and then converting it to ceramic using pyrolysis to form polymer derived ceramics (PDCs). AM of ceramic components using PDCs has been demonstrated with a number of high-cost techniques, but data is lacking for fused filament fabrication (FFF)-based 3-D printing. This study investigates the potential to use the lower-cost, more widespread and accessible FFF-based 3-D printing of PDCs. Low-cost FFF machines have a resolution limit set by the nozzle width, which is inferior to the resolutions obtained with expensive SLA or SLS AM systems. To match the performance a partial PDC conversion is used here, where only the outer surface of the printed polymer frame is converted to ceramic. Here the FFF-based 3-D printed sample is coated with a preceramic polymer and then it is converted into the corresponding PDC sample with a high temperature pyrolysis process. A screening experiment is performed on commercial filaments to obtain ceramic 3-D prints by surface coating both hard thermoplastics: poly lactic acid (PLA), polycarbonate (PC), nylon alloys, polypropylene (PP), polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and co-polyesters; and flexible materials including: flexible PLA, thermoplastic elastomer and thermoplastic polyurethane filaments. Mass and volume changes were quantified for the soaking and pyrolysis steps to form a hollow ceramic skin. All 3-D printing materials extruded at 250 microns successfully produced ceramics skins of less than 100 microns. Details on the advantages and disadvantages of the different 3-D printing polymer precursors are discussed for this processing regime. The results are analyzed and discussed in order to provide guidance for more widespread application of AM of PDCs.},

Instead of filament shape, the material in pellet form has a broad scope for 3D printing of flexible parts. Ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) material is widely used for the fabrication of flexible objects; however, the potential of this material has not been explored yet using the FDM process. In this study, flexible specimens of EVA material have been printed using a customized pellet based FDM system followed by the investigation on the effect of process parameters on tensile behavior. The effect of process parameters namely barrel temperature, platform temperature, build orientation, raster angle and number of contours have been studied on the tensile properties namely, ultimate tensile strength and \% elongation at break. Response surface methodology (RSM) and analysis of variance (ANOVA) techniques have been used to study the effect of process parameters for attaining optimum tensile properties. It was found that barrel temperature, raster angle, and platform temperature affect the tensile behavior of EVA specimens significantly. The maximum obtained values of ultimate tensile strength and elongation at break were 8.83 MPa and 522.34\% respectively. The outcome of the current study will help the engineers and designers to predict the tensile behavior of flexible parts for various applications.},

Design/methodology/approach Fracture load in a three-point bending test and calculated related stress were used as a measure. The samples were printed with the long side along the z -axis, thus, in the bend tests, the maximum stress occurred orthogonally to the layers. Temperature distribution on the sample surface during printing was monitored with a thermal imager. Sample mesostructure was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy. The influence of the extrusion temperature, the intensity of part cooling, the printing speed and the time between printing individual layers were considered. Findings It is shown that the optimization of the process parameters responsible for temperature conditions makes it possible to approximate the strength of the interlayer cohesion to the bulk material strength. Originality/value The novelty of the study consists in the generalization of the outcomes. All the parameters varied can be expressed through two factors, namely, the temperature of the previous layer and the extrusion efficiency, determining the ratio of the amount of extruded plastic to the calculated. A regression model was proposed that describes the effect of the two factors on the printed part strength. Along with interlayer bonding strength, these two factors determine the formation of the part mesostructure (the geometry of the boundaries between individual threads).},

HDPE was premixed with NIR to form N-HDPE masterbatch. A good interfacial bonding between PET matrix and HDPE dispersed phase with the help of compatibilizer was confirmed through Fourier transform-infrared spectra, scanning electron microscopy, and torque rheometer. For PET/N-HDPE composites, the major X-ray diffraction peaks and melting behaviors remained unchanged, indicating the limited alternation of crystalline structure for the composite systems with or without compatibilizer. The observed increment in the crystallization temperature of PET for the investigated PET/N-HDPE composites was mainly due to the nucleation role of both inorganic NIR and HDPE. Tensile strength and elongation at break for compatibilized cases at various N-HDPE contents conferred higher values than those of the corresponding counterparts without compatibilizer. Yet, Young's modulus for compatibilized systems was about 40\% lower than that for systems without compatibilizer, attributed to the rubbery nature of EGMA-VA. With the inclusion of NIR into HDPE to form PET/N-HDPE composites with or without EGMA-VA compatibilizer, the values of reflectance increased to a great degree. \textcopyright{} 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Plastic material blends can be fabricated using several techniques, which allows the molding of a compound adaptable to each needed performance. This fact favors the recycling by allowing the use of mixed wastes without major processes, avoiding expensive treatments. This research work analyzes the mechanical properties of a material conformed by 100\% recycled plastics: polyethylene terephthalate and low-/high-density polyethylene without previous separation or washing and drying pretreatments. Its macro and microscopic structure was studied and described, and formulations of different compound rates were analyzed. Mechanical resistance was around 60\% of a material composed of virgin materials in compressive, flexural, and tensile strength tests. Its potential application to building components manufacture is analyzed.},

The actuator proposed is a fuse filament fabrication (FFF) printed shape memory polymer (SMP) actuator that has nonlinear contractile and passive forces, contractile forces and strains comparable with mammalian skeletal muscle, reaction time under 1\,s, low operating temperature of 70\textdegree C, and has a low mass (74.0\,mg), volume (46.74\,mm3), and material costs of \$0.0098 per actuator. The FFF actuator is a SMP melt blend composite of polylactic acid and thermoplastic polyurethane with a mixture ratio of 7:3. The FFF actuator here has nonlinear contractile properties that have peak contractile stresses ranging from 0.58 to 0.17\,MPa for 100\textendash 60\% applied strains, respectively, where mammalian contraction values range from 0.1\,MPa (typical/average) to 0.45\,MPa (maximum). In addition, the optimal strain of 60\% has a strain recovery of 29.2\%, which is comparable with the 20\% for typical mammalian skeletal muscle strains. The actuator material was first characterized with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope (SEM), and tensile testing to determine the quality of extruded filament followed by force generation and strain recovery. Lastly, the FFF actuator was tested for thermal degradation and layer adhesion with SEM and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) testing. SEM imaging revealed that there are layer separations throughout the actuator and DSC showed thermal degradation caused by oxidation and random chain scission due to thermal cycling.},

However, with a wide range of low-cost FFF 3-D printers and settings possible, there is a lack of information on the variability in printed mechanical properties. This paper utilizes a large pool of 47 user-assembled 3-D printers to quantify the mechanical property variations of ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and yield strength of FFF printed components using ASTM D638-14 horizontally-oriented Type I and IV geometries for poly lactic acid (PLA). The results indicate that utilizing Type IV tensile test piece geometry may overestimate the UTS relative to the Type I. Furthermore, anisotropic mechanical property variances were quantified for Type IV specimens (vertical and horizontal orientations). Vertical tensile specimens had an ultimate tensile strength 47.9\% less than horizontal. Finally, the abundant supply of PLA 3-D prints suggest open-source printers assembled by individual operators can produce quality plastic components although the mechanical performance of the given part can vary dramatically based on the operator selection of printing parameters that provide a visually acceptable part.

Introduction With the open source introduction of fused filament fabrication (FFF) with the self REPlicating RAPid Prototyper (RepRap) [1-3] technology, the low-cost 3-D printing market has expanded [4]. The advancement of FFF requires quantitative mechanical property characterization [5] based on process parameters [6]. Significant efforts have been made on this front including investigating impact absorption [7], frictional performance [8], strain rate sensitivity [9], fatigue [10] and tensile strength [11, 12]. In addition, past work has evaluated the effects of colorants [13], raster [14], raster and thickness [15-17], layer orientation [18], infill patterns [19], ambient gas [20], vibration of printer [21], porosity [22] and the number of cycles through the system for recycled polymers [23]. Furthermore, composites have been evaluated for the inclusion of waste bio materials [24], nanoparticles [25], wood fibre [26], waste wood [27], fibre reinformcent [28] and carbon nanotubes [29] on mechanical properties. Layer-wise manufacturing methods induce directionally dependent mechanical properties [12, 30-33]. Anisotropy is most significant in a comparison between vertically and horizontally orientated, relative to the building platform, printed components. Optimized},

These capabilities have resulted in the application of MEX technologies in a diverse range of commercial fields including the development of functional engineering prototypes and systems, and the fabrication of high-value clinically functional materials. Despite the extensive application of MEX technologies, there remain significant opportunities for commercially relevant research contributions in this space. To provide insight into these opportunities, MEX technologies are characterized according to their fundamental technical capabilities and underlying materials science. An extended series of commercial best-practice applications is presented so that practicing designers and research engineers can more confidently develop commercial MEX applications with a workable understanding of the associated risks and opportunities.},

This trend has produced an interest in recycled filaments, both to reduce the manufacturing cost of fabricated products and to lower greenhouse gas emissions. Also, this recycling system is very useful to make functional filament such as highly conducting or high strength filament by combining carbon nanotube or polydopamine during recycling process. This study presents the design procedures of system for making recycled filaments for 3D printers from waste polymer. The system integrates four main parts for recycling filament: a shredder, which crushes polymer waste into small pieces; an extruder, which extrudes filament from the crushed pieces; a sensing and control component, which regulates the diameter of the extruded filament via a closed-loop control system, and a spooler. Additionally, the dimensional accuracy, the mechanical strength of pristine, and recycled filaments were investigated and compared.},

The addition of compatibilizers did not obviously change the size of R-PET fibers in MFCs. The toughness of MFC was significantly enhanced, and R-PET phase did not crystallize when 5\% E\textendash GMA was used.

The technology has traditionally been used by large companies to produce fit and form concept prototypes ('rapid prototyping') before production. In recent years however there has been a move to adopt the technology as full-scale manufacturing solution. The advent of low-cost, desktop 3D printers such as the RepRap and Fab@Home has meant a wider user base are now able to have access to desktop manufacturing platforms enabling them to produce highly customised products for personal use and sale. This uptake in usage has been coupled with a demand for printing technology and materials able to print functional elements such as electronic sensors. Here we present formulation of a simple conductive thermoplastic composite we term 'carbomorph' and demonstrate how it can be used in an unmodified low-cost 3D printer to print electronic sensors able to sense mechanical flexing and capacitance changes. We show how this capability can be used to produce custom sensing devices and user interface devices along with printed objects with embedded sensing capability. This advance in low-cost 3D printing with offer a new paradigm in the 3D printing field with printed sensors and electronics embedded inside 3D printed objects in a single build process without requiring complex or expensive materials incorporating additives such as carbon nanotubes.},

  abstract = {Printed 3D objects built by fused deposition modeling (FDM) are well-known to exhibit large anisotropic mechanical properties. This anisotropy is due to poor diffusion and entanglement of chains between filaments during the deposition process. A weak interlayer bond is thus formed. To combat anisotropy in FDM printed parts, our group has utilized bimodal blends of a chemically identical low molecular weight surface segregating additive (LMW-SuSA) blended with a bulk, commercially available poly(lactide) (PLA). Drastic improvements to the interlayer adhesion and a reduction in the anisotropic character are realized with the introduction of the LMW-SuSA. To expand our understanding of the mechanism responsible for this improvement, we report the introduction of LMW-SuSAs of miscible styrene-co-acrylonitrile (SAN), poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), and immiscible PLA to ABS and their impact on the mechanical properties of printed FDM parts. Decreases in the anisotropy of mechanical properties of ABS blends containing SAN (8.5k, 33k, and 75k), PMMA (33k, 67k, and 100k), and PLA (33k-3 arm and 220k) are tested. With the addition of 33k PMMA and 33k-3 arm PLA to ABS, the transversely oriented parts maximum stress increases by 40 and 25\%, respectively. A significant improvement in isotropy in the modulus is also observed. Interestingly, LMW-SuSAs of SAN do not improve the isotropy of the part. More importantly, experiments utilizing energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) confirm the surface segregation of LMW PMMA and PLA to the interfilament interface, indicating that improvements in layer adhesion are a result of increased diffusion and entanglement of chains across the interlayer interface.}

Increasing the PET content the \textregistered ber diameter became bigger and the diameter distribution wider, but the minimum \textregistered ber diameter always remained constant.},

The morphology of PET fibrils and the distribution of TiO2 particles in the composites were examined. After injection molding the preferential location of TiO2 particles is still preserved. Because of the reinforcement effect of PET fibrils, the tensile properties and impact strength of the PET/PP MFC are improved compared with the pure PP. Incorporation of TiO2 particles results in decrease of both tensile strength and impact strength of the composites. However, the compatibilized PET/PP/TiO2 MFC demonstrate better mechanical properties compared with the uncompatibilized ones. DMA analysis shows that the glass transition temperature (Tg) of PET in the uncompatibilized PET/PP/TiO2 MFC and the Tg of PP in the compatibilized PET/PP/TiO2 MFC are elevated by about 2\textdegree C. The elevation of Tg is attributed to the preferential location of TiO2 particles in the composites. \textcopyright{} 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Appl Polym Sci, 2009},

The effects of compatibilizer and TiO2 particles on the structure and properties of drawn strands were investigated. Upon addition of compatibilizer, the preferential location of TiO2 particles shifted from the PET-dispersed phase to the PP matrix, which brought about different structures of the drawn strands. Differential scanning calorimetry study provided indications for a heterogeneous nucleation effect of the PET fibrils on the PP matrix and of the TiO2 particles on the PET fibrils. Dynamic mechanical analysis demonstrated that the mechanical properties of the drawn strands are strongly dependent on the strand structures. \textcopyright{} 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In the uncompatibilized drawn strand, the generated PET microfibrils show large aspect ratio and wide distribution in diameter; whereas in the compatibilized drawn strand numbers of short needle-like PET formations appear and demonstrate uniform diameter distribution. Derived from PET droplets, the microfibril morphology is greatly influenced by the size of PET droplets in the extrudates: small droplet deforms into needle-like shape and large one becomes microfibril. In the compatibilized PET/PP/TiO2 extrudate, the size of PET droplet is much smaller than that in the uncompatibilized one. The reduction of droplet size is attributed to the low viscosity ratio between dispersed phase and matrix, which facilitates the break up of the dispersed PET droplets. \textcopyright{} 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In absence of PP-g-MA, the TiO2 nanoparticles were mainly located at the PET/PP interface and to a lesser extent in the dispersed PET droplets. As the TiO2 nanoparticles were coated by polyalcohol their surface could react with PP-g-MA and thus improving the compatibilization with PP. Therefore in presence of PP-g-MA the TiO2 nanoparticles were preferentially located in the PP. The incorporated TiO2 nanoparticles exerted a compatibilization effect on the PET/PP blend. Depending on the location of TiO2 three different compatibilization mechanisms were proposed to be at work: (1) Locating at the interface, the TiO2 nanoparticles decrease the free energy of mixing, and thus increase the thermodynamic stability of the nanocomposites; (2) The TiO2 nanoparticles at the interface also prevent the coalescence of PET droplets; (3) Preferentially located in the PP matrix, the TiO2 nanoparticles decreased the viscosity ratio which facilitated the droplet breakup of PET. \textcopyright{} 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The preferred location of the TiO2 nanoparticles was confirmed by SEM pictures taken from the chemically etched surface of the blends.

  abstract = {Un polym\`ere \`a empreintes mol\'eculaires (MIP) est un r\'ecepteur synth\'etique supramol\'eculaire, un mat\'eriau poss\'edant des cavit\'es pouvant reconna\^itre sp\'ecifiquement une mol\'ecule cible. Il est synth\'etis\'e en mettant en contact la mol\'ecule cible, avec un m\'elange de monom\`eres fonctionnels et r\'eticulants qui permettent d'obtenir un r\'eseau polym\'erique tridimensionnel rigide. L'\'elimination de la mol\'ecule empreinte laissera des sites vides compl\'ementaires de cette derni\`ere. Ces cavit\'es sont maintenant capables de la recapturer sp\'ecifiquement. Ces polym\`eres sont utilis\'es dans les domaines tels que l'extraction en phase solide, la chromatographie d'affinit\'e, la catalyse enzymatique, les biocapteurs et la vectorisation des m\'edicaments. Bien que le concept des MIPs a pour origine les travaux r\'ealis\'es sur des mat\'eriaux sol-gel imprim\'es dans les ann\'ees 1930, ces derniers sont rest\'es dans l'ombre jusqu'\`a l'introduction de polym\`eres organiques imprim\'es plus versatiles. Par rapport aux MIPs organiques, les MIPs sol-gel pr\'esentent quelques avantages comme une plus grande stabilit\'e thermique, une meilleure compatibilit\'e avec l'eau et une plus grande porosit\'e. Dans cette th\`ese, nous avons d\'evelopp\'e des MIPs organiques et des MIPs sol-gel pour leur application en cosm\'etologie et pour la vectorisation de m\'edicaments. Dans la premi\`ere partie, nous pr\'esentons des MIPs pouvant adsorber d'une fa\c{c}on sp\'ecifique l'acide ol\'eique (OA), un biomarqueur de l'\'etat pelliculaire sur le cuir chevelu. Pour la pr\'eparation des MIPs organiques, nous avons employ\'e plusieurs monom\`eres basiques dont l'acryloylaminobenzamidine (AB), que nous avons tout sp\'ecialement synth\'etis\'e. Tous les MIPs pouvaient lier l'OA mais beaucoup d'interaction non-sp\'ecifique \'etait observ\'e. D'autre part, les MIPs sol-gel pr\'esentaient une bonne reconnaissance sp\'ecifique et une capacit\'e \'elev\'ee pour OA; par exemple, un MIP de composition OA:APTES:TEOS = 1:1.6:1.7 pouvait adsorber 625 {$\mu$}mol.g-1 de OA dans le s\'ebum artificiel. Des tests pour capturer l'OA sur le stratum corneum et la peau reconstruite (Episkin) ont \'egalement \'et\'e effectu\'es. La p\'en\'etration de l'OA sur les deux types de peau \'etait plus faible en pr\'esence de MIP que de NIP. Les MIPs comme mat\'eriaux d\'esodorisants font l'objet de la deuxi\`eme partie de cette th\`ese. Des MIPs pouvant adsorber les pr\'ecurseurs de mol\'ecules malodorantes comme les conjugu\'es glutamine des acides (E)-3-m\'ethyl-2-hex\'eno\"ique (3M2H) et 3-hydroxy-3-m\'ethyl-hexano\"ique (3H3MH) ont \'et\'e pr\'epar\'es. Le N-hexanoyl glutamine et le N-hexanoyl glutamate ont \'et\'e utilis\'es comme template. Nous observons que le MIP synth\'etis\'e avec AB comme monom\`ere fonctionnel poss\`ede la plus grande capacit\'e d'adsorption pour le N-hexanoyl glutamine, ainsi que pour les pr\'ecurseurs glutamines des mol\'ecules malodorantes. Des r\'esultats pr\'eliminaires et tr\`es prometteurs ont \'egalement \'et\'e obtenus dans la sueur. La derni\`ere partie de cette th\`ese concerne des MIPs pour la vectorisation de m\'edicaments. L'acide salicylique (SA) est un m\'edicament efficace utilis\'e dans le traitement de l'acn\'e. Des MIPs organiques et sol-gel contre SA ont \'et\'e synth\'etis\'es. Les MIPs sol-gel ont une plus grande capacit\'e d'adsorption, 180 {$\mu$}mol.g-1, que les MIPs organiques et ils lient le SA sept fois plus que le NIP. Les tests de relargage du SA ont \'et\'e effectu\'es dans plusieurs milieux, avec la plus grande efficacit\'e dans l'eau pure. En conclusion, les applications de MIPs en cosm\'etologie et en vectorisation de m\'edicaments ont \'et\'es \'etudi\'es. Nos r\'esultats montrent que les MIPs sol-gel sont les plus appropri\'es pour ce type de travail.},

The composition consisted of the conventional sustained-release pharmaceutical excipients without addition of foaming agent or light materials. First, the proper alcohol/water proportion was selected for the binding agent. The desired drug release behaviors and good floating properties were obtained either through modification of the formulation composition or adjustment of the internal structure. In vitro, the printed tablets were evaluated for drug release, mechanical properties, lag time, and floating duration time. The in vivo behaviors of the formulations were noted at certain time intervals through assessment of the radiographic pictures of healthy volunteers. The gastric retention time in the 3D-printed tablet was approximately 6~h in vivo. Results indicated these puerarin gastric floating 3D-printed tablets had great potential to achieve good gastric residence time and controlled release. Therefore, 3D extrusion-based printing appears to be appropriate for the production of oral administration systems, owing to its flexibility and the great floating ability and controlled-release capacity of its products.},

The novel structures of 3D-printed tablets with five different values were formed by printing paths, which established a flexible way of adjusting in vitro drug release. An obvious acceleration (85\% of cumulative release about 7.5 min at the soonest) was observed for the tablets with internal structural design. It was inferred that puerarin formed simple eutectic mixtures with PEG 4000 and that puerarin dispersed into the carrier based on DSC and X-Ray powder diffraction (XRD). This highlights the combined advantage of PEG as a soluble polymer with TE 3D printing and provides a suitable system for rapid puerarin release.},

In order to balance PEEK's mechanical and osseointegration properties, a novel surface porous PEEK (SP-PEEK) is successfully fabricated by fused deposition modelling three-dimensional printing (FDM 3DP) and characterized by mechanical and osteogenesis in vitro tests. Moreover, the effects of pore diameter and pore layer number on the mechanical behaviors of SP-PEEK are investigated by theoretical model and numerical simulation. Comparison among experimental, theoretical and simulation results show good agreement. As pore diameter decreases, the equivalent strength and modulus become more sensitive to the decrease of pore layer number. In addition, the SP-PEEK exhibits the mechanical properties within the range of human trabecular bone and cortical bone, and thus can be tailored to mimic human bone by adjusting the pore diameter and pore layer number, which is benefit to mitigate stress shielding. The effects of pore diameter on the cell proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of SP-PEEK are tested by the co-culture of osteoblast precursor cells (MC3T3-E1) and SP-PEEK round discs. Results showcase that porous surface improves the osteogenesis in vitro, and the SP-PEEK group that the pore diameter is 0.6~mm exhibits optimal-performance osteogenesis in vitro.},

  abstract = {Packaging plastics are called `single-use plastics' because of short lifetime. Among which, the three plastics of polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) take more than 70\%. Due to incompatibility, few research has been done on the alloy of the three plastics. The aim of this study is to investigate the possibility of single-use plastic alloy (SUPA) of ternary PE, PP, and PET as the 3D printing material. Tensile and bending tests are carried out to investigate the mechanical properties, photographs of scanning electron microscope (SEM) are taken for morphology analysis, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) are used to study the crystallization behavior of the alloys. The results show that there is an optimal ratio for all the components to obtain the best mechanical performances, i.e., the ratio of with 20 wt\% PET, 2 wt\% maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene (PP-g-MAH) and 2 wt\% organic modified montmorillonite (OMMT). This SUPA has a tensile strength of 14.48 MPa, a tensile modulus of 586.42 MPa, a flexural strength of 15.85 MPa, and a flexural modulus of 544.67 MPa. Due to the function of compatibilizer and nanoclay (NC) will be affected by redundancy, the potential primary fibrosis while collecting the feeding filaments and the secondary fibrosis at the nozzle of 3D printing might be responsible for the variation of the mechanical performances.},

The effects of compatibilization of these polymers were analyzed by SEM, which shows reduction of the size of PET granules, and by TGA, with an increase in the thermal stability of the compatibilized blends. Thermal properties corresponding to melting and crystallization events were also changed by the introduction of the compatibilizers. The DMTA shows that the Tg of the PET domain is affected by compatibilization, contrary to the Tg of PP domain.

The low adhesion between the clay and polymer molecules, in general, is one of the major challenges faced while blending the two components.

Various proportions for both polymeric, High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) \& Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET), plastics wastes additives, in three grain-size are added to the earth clay. Prepared samples were tested for thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity, time lag and decrement factor properties. Collected findings showed that thermal con\- ductivity and specific heat capacity properties improved by 40\% and 55\%, respectively, with the incorporation the largest polymeric-grain additives (3 mm {$<$} {$\delta$} {$\leq$} 6 mm) compared to the smallest ones ({$\delta$} {$\leq$} 1 mm). This can be explained by the high porosity produced while using larger grain-size additives. Maxwell thermal-porosity mathematical model is also used to assess the theoretically predicted thermal properties of the brick samples and compare it the experimental findings. The computed Pearson Correlation Coefficient `R' is found to be very close to 1; hence, reflecting a positive association between the experimental and theoretical results. Next, a dynamic thermal inertia via a thermal simulation of a 6 m \texttimes{} 5 m x 2 m reference house, with variable external wall thicknesses, is executed to analyze the time lag and decrement factor of the studied brick samples. The composition of the wall is based on the experimental results of the brick samples with the optimum compressive strength, deduced from previous work, and thermal performance, in the current study. An improvement in thermal stability, with increased time lag and decreased decrement factor, is observed with larger grain size additives and thicker external walls. As a matter of fact, for a 0.3 m thick external wall made of PET based samples, the recorded time lag and decrement factor was 13.50 h and 0.148, respectively, compared to 8.99 h and 0.346 for reference values. This represents very high gains in dynamic thermal inertia properties in the range of 50\% and 57\% for time lag and decrement factor, respectively, compared to reference values, meaning cutting the house's energy expenses in half.},

Maleic anhydride grafted PP (PP-g-MA) was used to modify the compatibility. The relationships among components, structure, and properties of the PP composites were studied. The results show that adding nano-CaCO3 improved the mechanical properties of the materials. Adding PET fiber increased the rigidity and toughness but the tensile strength decreased.

Both PET fiber and nano-CaCO3 had nucleation effect on the PP crystallization and slightly induced the formation of {$\beta$} crystals. Ternary {$\beta$}-PP/nano-CaCO3/PET fiber composites contained high {$\beta$}-crystal content, and the compatibilizer exhibited synergy effect with {$\beta$} nucleating agent to further increase the {$\beta$}-crystal content in the blends.

  abstract = {Many recycled plastics are the polypropylene (PP)/poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) blends with PET as the minor component. The modification of such kinds of PP/PET blends for higher performance is essential as PP and PET are not thermodynamically compatible. In this study, the elastomer, SEBS-g-MAH, and the inorganics, halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) are chosen as the modifiers for the modification of a model PP/PET blend (90/10). The mechanical performance of such blend is optimized by the selective dispersion of the nanotubular HNTs into the interfacial region of the blends via a two-step process. Compared with the control one, the overall mechanical properties of the blend are substantially improved. The crystallization of PP in the blend is also facilitated by the selective dispersion of HNTs and the folding surface free energy is substantially increased. The substantially improved mechanical performance is interpreted according to the formation of the unique morphology. This study provides new insight in improving the performance of polymer blends via selectively dispersing the nanosized inorganics in the blend. \textcopyright{} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl.

This paper proposes a single-layer temperature-adjusting transition (SLTAT) method to improve bond strength between dissimilar materials with different melting temperatures by adjusting the bonding-layer temperature. Herein, the bonding-layer temperature effects on the tensile strength of polycaprolactone (PCL)/polylactic acid (PLA) structures were investigated. PCL/PLA parts prepared with this method had 28\% higher tensile strength than unprocessed parts when the bonding-layer temperature was 130\,\textdegree C. Bonding mechanism was proposed to explain the failure modes of the PCL/PLA parts after tensile testing. Freeze-fractured surfaces of SLTAT-processed PCL/PLA specimens were observed to better understand the correlations between bonding-layer temperature and tensile strength. This approach is promising to apply in ordinary multi-material FDM processing without adding additional equipment or compromising dimensional accuracy.},

  abstract = {The 72-hour time period immediately following a natural disaster is when the affected people are in the most need of relief aid [1]. During this time period, relief aid organizations suffer from bottlenecked and expensive supply chains that are required to transport items to a post-disaster area. In addition to these complexities, communication about what supplies are needed in the affected areas is often minimal or completely cut off. Therefore, relief organizations must rely on estimates to decide on what supplies are brought and the quantity of said supplies. There is a need for a way to provide those affected by disaster with exactly the supplies needed to increase the speed and effectiveness of the relief aid supply chain. Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) is common type of 3D printing technology that demonstrates the capabilities needed to help solve the problems in the relief aid supply chain. In this paper the use of 3D printing in disaster relief scenarios is reviewed, and a new 3D printer designed specifically for use in disaster relief efforts is introduced. Commercially available 3D printers are designed to operate in stationary, low-stress environments, usually a home or office. Because of this, current 3D printers are not designed for frequent travel, operation in harsh outdoor environments, or use away from reliable power sources and are therefore not well suited for humanitarian relief situations. These attributes are critical needs for equipment that is operated in disaster relief areas. The 3D printer developed herein is designed to succeed where other printers fail by being portable, durable, and off-grid capable. The design addressed portability by maximizing the build-volume-to-footprint ratio. This was down with the implementation of a novel X and Z linear motion control, and fold-able frame design. Durability was considered by the use of a sturdy frame, isolated electronics, and ability to be enclosed from the environment. Lastly the integration of an integrated battery system gives the printer the ability to operate off-grid. This paper discusses the design considerations for this technology, as well as the importance of portability, off-grid capability, and durability as design features for a 3D printer to be used in humanitarian relief scenarios.},

  abstract = {This study explores the potential to reach a circular economy for post-consumer Recycled Polyethylene Terephthalate (rPET) packaging and bottles by using it as a Distributed Recycling for Additive Manufacturing (DRAM) feedstock. Specifically, for the first time, rPET water bottle flake is processed using only an open source toolchain with Fused Particle Fabrication (FPF) or Fused Granular Fabrication (FGF) processing rather than first converting it to filament. In this study, first the impact of granulation, sifting, and heating (and their sequential combination) is quantified on the shape and size distribution of the rPET flakes. Then 3D printing tests were performed on the rPET flake with two different feed systems: an external feeder and feed tube augmented with a motorized auger screw, and an extruder-mounted hopper that enables direct 3D printing. Two Gigabot X machines were used, each with the different feed systems, and one without and the latter with extended part cooling. 3D print settings were optimized based on thermal characterization, and both systems were shown to 3D print rPET directly from shredded water bottles. Mechanical testing showed the importance of isolating rPET from moisture and that geometry was important for uniform extrusion. The mechanical strength of 3D-printed parts with FPF and inconsistent flow is lower than optimized fused filament, but adequate for a wide range of applications. Future work is needed to improve consistency and enable water bottles to be used as a widespread DRAM feedstock.},

The scanning electron micrographs revealed that the nanoparticles could have different effects on microfibril formation of PET/PP MFC depending on their concentration. Addition of appropriate content of nanoparticles (e.g., 1.6 and 8 wt\%) facilitated the PET droplet-fibril transition during stretching due to the presence of nanosilica in the PP matrix, which increased the viscosity of PP matrix and then improved the droplet deformability. However, at higher loading (e.g., 12 wt\%), the aggregation of silica nanoparticles around the PET droplets prevented disperse phase coalescence during drawing and then reduced the fibrillation ability of PET minor phase. The dynamic rheological test performed at 190\textdegree C showed that the increased spatial restriction of the nanoparticles improved the viscoelastic moduli and complex viscosity of PET/PP MFC. DSC results indicated that nanosilica had little heterogeneous nucleation effect on the PP matrix of PET/PP MFC. Additionally, nanoparticles could present drastic improvement in the degradation behavior of PET/PP MFC under thermo-oxidative conditions and increased the modulus of PET/PP MFC. POLYM.

Using plastic pellets as printing materials gives advantages in cost, processing speed, and available materials. In this work, a large-scale double-screw FDM three-dimensional printer based on plastic pellets has been designed. It is capable of printing large plastic products at a low cost and high speed. Using ABS + 10\%GF as printing material, this work is first focused on the effects of the pressure and speed of the metering screw on the flowrate of melt. The equation for the relationship of these three parameters was established as well. Based on this equation, the effects of melt flow, printing speed, and layer thickness on the width of fused filament were investigated with experiments. Furthermore, the effects of printing spacing between fused filaments on surface accuracy and bonding strength were also explored. By printing models, it was revealed that the designed printer is able to print products with plastic pellets. \textcopyright{} 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym. Sci. 2017, 134, 45147.},

For this purpose, HDPE-g-mPOE graft copolymers were prepared in HDPE/mPOE blends via reactive extrusion with the presence of the free radical initiator dicumyl peroxide (DCP). Then, R-PET was blended with the HDPE/mPOE blends by melt extrusion. The effect of the DCP and mPOE content in the HDPE/mPOE blends on the phase morphology and mechanical properties of the R-PET/HDPE/mPOE blends were studied systematically. It was found that the blends containing reactive compatibilizer exhibited the encapsulation of the HDPE by the mPOE, forming core?shell particles dispersed phase morphology. The graft chains of HDPE-g-mPOE-g-PET formed by the in situ reaction between R-PET and mPOE phases reduced the interfacial tension. Consequently, the dispersed phase morphology was observed to form smaller diameter core?shell particles. The resultant blends exhibited an effect on both the thermal and mechanical properties. Differential scanning calorimetric analysis showed the dispersed phase particles could act as a nucleating agent in the R-PET matrix to improve the crystallization temperature, while the graft copolymers formed in the compatibilized R-PET/HDPE/mPOE blend decreased the nucleation activity.

  abstract = {This work presents the experimental results of the mechanical and fracture behaviour of three polymeric blends prepared from two recycled plastics, namely polypropylene and opaque poly (ethylene terephthalate), where the second one acted as a reinforcement phase. The raw materials were two commercial degrees of recycled post-consumer waste, i.e., rPP and rPET-O. Sheets were manufactured by a semi-industrial extrusion-calendering process. The mechanical and fracture behaviours of manufactured sheets were analyzed via tensile tests and the essential work of fracture approach. SEM micrographics of cryofractured sheets revelated the development of in situ rPP/rPET-O microfibrillar composites when 30 wt.\% of rPET-O was added. It was observed that the yield stress was not affected with the addition of rPET-O. However, the microfibrillar structure increased the Young's modulus by more than a third compared with rPP, fulfilling the longitudinal value predicted by the additive rule of mixtures. Regarding the EWF analysis, the resistance to crack initiation was highly influenced by the resistance to its propagation owing to morphology-related instabilities during tearing. To analyze the initiation stage, a partition energy method was successfully applied by splitting the total work of fracture into two specific energetic contributions, namely initiation and propagation. The results revelated that the specific essential initiation-related work of fracture was mainly affected by rPET-O phase. Remarkably, its value was significantly improved by a factor of three with the microfibrillar structure of rPET-O phase. The results allowed the exploration of the potential ability of manufacturing in situ MFCs without a ``precursor'' morphology, providing an economical way to promote the recycling rate of PET-O, as this material is being discarded from current recycling processes.},

  abstract = {Multi-material extrusion in 3D printing is gaining attention due to a wide range of possibilities that it provides, specially driven by the commercial availability of a large variety of non-conventional filament materials. As a result, one can print models that are not limited to aesthetics purposes but can now also provide larger functionality, and therefore with mechanical performance tuned according to their purpose. With this in mind, this paper addresses the mechanical performance of multi-material printed objects, specially focused on the interface zone generated between the different materials at their geometrical boundaries. Tensile test specimens were designed and printed in three types: (A) a single-material specimen printed by a single extrusion head; (B) a single-material but multi-section specimen printed in a zebra-crossing structure by two extrusion heads; and (C) a multi-material specimen printed with two materials in a zebra-crossing pattern. The materials considered were PLA, TPU and PET. The comparison of the mechanical performance between Type-A and -B specimens demonstrated the negative influence of the presence of a geometrical boundary interface between the same material. On the other hand, the comparison between Type-B and -C demonstrated how the previous performance loss was yet more drastic when the lack of chemical affinity between the materials was present. The methodology proposed to assess the quality of the pairs of materials selected is innovative, and enabled to depict the importance of the boundary design in multi-material printing techniques.}

Additive manufacturing (AM) is nowadays one of the most suitable technologies for the preparation of structures with strictly defined complex three-dimensional architectures. Moreover, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging can be employed to obtain personalized medical devices. Fused deposition modeling (FDM) is one of the most common, easiest, and cost-effective AM techniques to obtain 3D objects from a wide variety of materials. However, there is a lack of bioresorbable materials that can fit the increasing demand for biomedical applications requiring stiff elastomers. In this work, a series of bioresorbable segmented poly(ester urethanes) (SPEU) with high hard segment content was synthesized and physicochemically characterized. The materials with higher thermal stability were processed into homogeneous filaments by hot-melt extrusion with no need for additives nor plasticizers. These filaments were evaluated for FDM, and structures with controlled porosity, filament diameter, and in-plane pore size could be easily obtained by modifying the printing parameters. Regarding SPEU mechanical properties, the obtained scaffolds could be promising for cartilage tissue engineering applications.},

Funded by Forest and Wood Products Australia (FWPA), the research intends to valorise forest and plastic waste by combining saw dust with recycled acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) to develop an environmentally sustainable composite material suitable for 3D printing, using a fused filament fabrication process. First, the research explores the mechanical performance and printability of wood-plastic composites and variations in their respective compositions and second, it develops new 3D printing processes that achieve material and aesthetic gradients through the optimisation of printing parameters and development of printing algorithms. The aim is to achieve a fluidly variable gradient material that represents a new design paradigm in architecture and replaces traditional architectural systems that rely on the mechanical layering of different elements such as structure, rain screen, insulation, lining etc. Preliminary testing showed that from a perspective of environmental sustainability, the unproblematic recycling of these Microtimber specimen promises to close the loop between the material sourcing stages and the end of life management of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA).},

An integrated approach of imaging technology, segmentation using MIMICS software package and rapid prototyping technology was adopted in order to construct the human knee joint bones. Models of all the human knee joint bones- the femur, tibia, fibula and patella were constructed. The Patella bone in specific was constructed exactly as the same size of the original patella bone and was qualitatively validated by an expert anatomist and found to be satisfactory in design and the surface finish which may possibly be affected by mesh generation during a constructing phase in MIMICS software. As far as limitations are concerned, the femur, tibia and fibula bones exceeded the maximum dimensions of the ``U Print SE Plus'' 3D printer (203 x 203 x 152 mm). Followed by another limitation is that ABS plus \textendash{} P430 and P400 thermoplastic are the only compatible material and other materials such as ABS-M30, PC-ABS, PC, Nylon 12 are not compatible with the machine. This paper deliberates a 3D visualization of the human knee bone model, particularly the patella which is constructed in its original size and was found to be validated. The present study enhances the versatility of fabricating bone models by RP for implantation as well for pre complex surgical studies.},

First, production rates are extremely low. Second, the physical size of the parts is generally small, less than a cubic foot. Third, the mechanical properties of the polymer parts are generally poor, limiting the potential for direct part replacement and functional use of the polymer components. This article describes various ways in which carbon fibers (CFs) can be used to address these fundamental hurdles. First, CF-reinforced polymers developed for AM have demonstrated specific strengths approaching aerospace-quality aluminum. Second, CF additions can radically reduce the distortion and warping of the material during deposition, which enables large-scale, out-of-the-oven, high deposition rate manufacturing. Finally, the complementary nature of CF technology and AM is discussed, showing how merging the two manufacturing processes enables the construction of complex components that would not be possible with either technology alone.},

  abstract = {Additive manufacturing is becoming an increasingly important technique for the production of dental restorations and assistive devices. The most commonly used systems are based on vat polymerization, e.g., stereolithography (SLA) and digital light processing (DLP). In contrast, fused filament fabrication (FFF), also known under the brand name fused deposition modeling (FDM), is rarely applied in the dental field. This might be due to the reduced accuracy and resolution of FFF compared to vat polymerization. However, the use of FFF in the dental sector seems very promising for in-house production since it presents a cost-effective and straight forward method. The manufacturing of nearly ready-to-use parts with only minimal post-processing can be considered highly advantageous. Therefore, the objective was to implement FFF in a digital dental workflow. The present report demonstrates the production of surgical guides for implant insertion by FFF. Furthermore, a novel approach using a temperature-sensitive filament for bite registration plates holds great promise for a simplified workflow. In combination with a medical-grade filament, a multi-material impression tray was printed for optimized impression taking of edentulous patients. Compared to the conventional way, the printed thermoplastic material is pleasant to model and can allow clean and fast work on the patient.},

  abstract = {The global plastics production has increased annually and a substantial part is used for packaging (in Europe 39\%). Most plastic packages are discarded after a relatively short service life and the resulting plastic packaging waste is subsequently landfilled, incinerated or recycled. Laws of several European and Asian countries require that plastic packaging waste collected from households has to be sorted, reprocessed, compounded and reused. These recycling schemes typically produce milled goods of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), poly(ethylene) (PE), isotactic poly(propylene) (PP), mixed plastics, and agglomerates from film material. The present study documents the composition and properties of post-consumer polyolefin recyclates originating from both source separation and mechanical recovery from municipal solid refuse waste (MSRW). The overall composition by Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were determined and compared with the sorting results of the sorted fractions prior to the reprocessing into milled goods. This study shows that the collection method for the plastic packaging waste has hardly any influence on the final quality of the recyclate; however, the sorting and reprocessing steps influence the final quality of the recyclate. Although the mechanical properties of recyclate are clearly different than those of virgin polymers, changes to the sorting and reprocessing steps can improve the quality.},

  abstract = {According to research findings of many peer-reviewed studies, up to 90\% of household items may be made of plastic. But nowadays, just a small portion of plastic waste is recycled. Plastic pyrolysis and polymer breakdown are environmentally hazardous. Processing is, therefore, necessary for recycling. Plastics are constantly being manufactured and require minimal processing, necessitating innovation. Plastic recycling is becoming a major issue for environmentalists and waste management professionals. Fused deposition modelling, or FDM, is one of the most popular types of additive manufacturing. It uses the melt extrusion process to deposit filaments of thermal polymers in a predetermined pattern. Using a computer-generated design, 3D printing, sometimes referred to as additive manufacturing, is a technique for building three-dimensional objects layer by layer. A 3D item is produced by the additive method of 3D printing, which involves building up layers of material. To make a three-dimensional object, FDM printers eject a thermoplastic filament that has been heated to its melting point layer by layer. 3D printing is a rapidly expanding industry and the market in this field has grown up to 23\% by 2021. Several experiments on new 3D printing materials have been carried out to reduce pollution and the supply of plastic. Various additives have been investigated to increase recycled polymers' molecular weight and mechanical properties. The most frequent type of fibre found in that is thermoplastic fibre. In this instance, waste ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) plastic from industrial FDM printers was gathered and examined in a bustling open shop. In this review, we discussed the use of recyclable polymers in 3D printing for waste material management.},

These objects were produced without any sacrificial structures or additional support materials, just by precisely tuning the nozzle heating, fan cooling and translation velocity parameters. The manufactured microporous structures out of polylactic acid (PLA) had fully controllable porosity (20\%\textendash 60\%) and consisted of desired volume pores (\textasciitilde 0.056 {$\mu$}m3). The prepared scaffolds showed biocompatibility and were suitable for the primary stem cell growth. In addition, direct laser writing (DLW) ablation was employed to modify the surfaces of the PLA structures, drill holes, as well as shape the outer geometries of the created objects. The proposed combination of FFF printing with DLW offers successful fabrication of 3D microporous structures with functionalization capabilities, such as the modification of surfaces, the generation of grooves and microholes and cutting out precisely shaped structures (micro-arrows, micro-gears). The produced structures could serve as biomedical templates for cell culturing, as well as biodegradable implants for tissue engineering. The additional micro-architecture is important in connection with the cell types used for the intention of cell growing. Moreover, we show that surface roughness can be modified at the nanoscale by immersion into an acetone bath, thus increasing the hydrophilicity. The approach is not limited to biomedical applications, it could be employed for the manufacturing of bioresorbable 3D microfluidic and micromechanic structures.},

  abstract = {The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has provided a unique set of global supply chain limitations with an exponentially growing surge of patients requiring care. The needs for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for hospital staff and doctors have been overwhelming, even just to rule out patients not infected. High demand for traditionally manufactured devices, challenged by global demand and limited production, has resulted in a call for additive manufactured (3D printed) equipment to fill the gap between traditional manufacturing cycles. This method has the unique ability to pivot in real time, while traditional manufacturing may take months to change production runs. 3D printing has been used to produce a variety of equipment for hospitals including face shields, masks, and even ventilator components to handle the surge. This type of rapid, crowd sourced, design and production resulted in new challenges for regulation, liability, and distribution. This manuscript reviews these challenges and successes of additive manufacturing and provides a forward plan for hospitals to consider for future surge events. Recommendations: To accommodate future surges, hospitals and municipalities should develop capacity for short-run custom production, enabling them to validate new designs. This will rapidly increase access to vetted equipment and critical network sharing with community distributed manufacturers and partners. Clear guidance and reviewed design repositories by regulatory authorities will streamline efforts to combat future pandemic waives or other surge events.},

  abstract = {Fibers spun by melt spinning of binary and ternary polypropylene/polyethylenetherephthalate blends have been produced and characterized in order to investigate the effect of a compatibilizer on their morphology and mechanical properties. The compatibilizer was a maleic anhydride-functionalized rubber copolymer. The effect of the compatibilizer was well evident in the isotropic state, as the morphology became very fine, the size of the dispersed particles was very small, and the adhesion was better. The effect of the compatibilizer on the mechanical properties is very relevant, especially in the elongation at break. On the contrary, no relevant effect was observed in the anisotropic oriented fibers. Although the average diameter of the microfibrils of the dispersed phase of the compatibilized blend generated during the hot drawing was much smaller than that of the microfibrils of the same particles of the uncompatibilized blend, the mechanical properties were almost the same. This behavior has been attributed to the length of the smaller microfibrils of the ternary blends, which was lower that of the microfibrils of the binary blend. This has been explained in terms of reduced initial droplet size, and therefore of lesser possibility of stretching the droplets to very long fibrils in these samples.},

All the samples were prepared by melt mixing. PP/rPET and PP/rPET/GnP isotropic sheets were prepared by compression molding, whereas the anisotropic fibers were spun using a drawing module of a capillary viscometer. The results obtained showed that the viscosity of the blend is reduced by the presence of GnP due to the lubricating effect of the graphene platelets. However, the Cox\textendash Merz rule is not respected. Compared to the PP/rPET blend, the GnP led to a slight increase in the elastic modulus. However, it causes a slight decrease in elongation at break. Morphological analysis revealed a poor adhesion between the PP and PET phases. Moreover, GnPs distribute around the droplets of the PET phase with a honey-like appearance. Finally, the effect of the orientation on both systems gives rise not only to fibers with higher modulus values, but also with high deformability and a fibrillar morphology of the dispersed PET phase. A fragile-ductile transition driven by the orientation was observed in both systems.},

  abstract = {Cardiovascular diseases constitute a number of conditions which are the leading cause of death globally. To combat these diseases and improve the quality and duration of life, several cardiac implants have been developed, including stents, vascular grafts and valvular prostheses. The implantation of these vascular prosthesis has associated risks such as infection or blood clot formation. In order to overcome these limitations medicated vascular prosthesis have been previously used. The present paper describes a 3D printing method to develop medicated vascular prosthesis using fused deposition modelling (FDM) technology. For this purpose, rifampicin (RIF) was selected as a model molecule as it can be used to prevent vascular graft prosthesis infection. Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) and RIF were combined using hot melt extrusion (HME) to obtain filaments containing RIF concentrations ranging between 0 and 1\% (w/w). These materials are capable of providing RIF release for periods ranging between 30 and 80~days. Moreover, TPU-based materials containing RIF were capable of inhibiting the growth of Staphylococcus aureus. This behaviour was observed even for TPU-based materials containing RIF concentrations of 0.1\% (w/w). TPU containing 1\% (w/w) of RIF showed antimicrobial properties even after 30~days of RIF release. Alternatively, these methods were used to prepare dipyridamole containing TPU filaments. Finally, using a dual extrusion 3D printer vascular grafts containing both drugs were prepared.},

The objective is the polyethylene terephthalate (PET) valorization from postconsumer bottles by the optimization of the most suitable virgin and recycled PET mixture to be used as food contact packaging. Mixtures of these materials were elaborated by extrusion and injection molding using different recycled PET rates. Rheological, mechanical, and thermal analyses were achieved, and then migration tests were investigated to assess the recycled PET compatibility for food contact packaging. The rheological analysis showed a PET degradation after the mechanical recycling, with PET viscosity decrease, compared to that of the virgin material. The blends properties showed that at low deformation, mechanical properties were significantly improved by adding recycled PET. Consequently, the new material was more rigid with a crystallinity degree improvement, increasing the materials resistance that enhanced their tenacity. However, at great deformations, the PET mixed materials were deteriorated through drastic ductility losses. The mixture 30/70 recycled/virgin PET seems to be the best blend. For all the studied mixtures, the overall migrations conformed the European Standard, allowing the use of the recycled PET for packaging as an issue in circular economy principles for a sustainable development.

  abstract = {Catheter-associated infections are a common complication that occurs in dialysis patients. Current strategies to prevent infection include catheter coatings containing heparin, pyrogallol, or silver nanoparticles, which all have an increased risk of causing resistance in bacteria. Therefore, a novel approach for manufacture, such as the use of additive manufacturing (AM), also known as three-dimensional (3D) printing, is required. Filaments were produced by extrusion using thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) and tetracycline hydrochloride (TC) in various concentrations (e.g., 0, 0.25, 0.5, and 1\%). The extruded filaments were used in a fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printer to print catheter constructs at varying concentrations. Release studies in phosphate-buffered saline, microbiology studies, thermal analysis, contact angle, attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray microcomputer tomography ({$\mu$}CT) analysis were conducted on the printed catheters. The results suggested that TC was uniformly distributed within the TPU matrix. The microbiology testing of the catheters showed that devices containing TC had an inhibitory effect on the growth of Staphylococcus aureus NCTC 10788 bacteria. Catheters containing 1\% TC maintained inhibitory effect after 10 day release studies. After an initial burst release in the first 24 h, there was a steady release of TC in all concentrations of catheters. 3D-printed antibiotic catheters were successfully printed with inhibitory effect on S. aureus bacteria. Finally, TC containing catheters showed resistance to S. aureus adherence to their surfaces when compared with catheters containing no TC. Catheters containing 1\% of TC showed a bacterial adherence reduction of up to 99.97\%. Accordingly, the incorporation of TC to TPU materials can be effectively used to prepare anti-infective catheters using FDM. This study highlights the potential for drug-impregnated medical devices to be created through AM.},

Hot melt extrusion at 170~\textdegree C was used to prepare the filaments, and the fused deposition modeling technique was employed to print tablets. Drug release profiles were obtained by in vitro tests. The results indicate that the mixture containing 10~wt.\% of polyethylene glycol prepared as a solid dispersion exhibits the most straightforward structure and shows only the slightest deviation from the target filament diameter. The compact structure of the tablet obtained from the filament provides a uniform in vitro drug release over a 24-h period. It also shows the smallest aberration from the expected DNR content in the tablet. The paper demonstrates that a blend containing 10~wt.\% of PEG, 10~wt.\% of DNR, and 80~wt.\% of PVA filament is the most appropriate formula for extrusion and tablet printing.},

  abstract = {The influence of the molecular weight of polyethylene on the morphology and mechanical properties of blends of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) dispersed as droplets in a poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) matrix at various compositions was investigated. The difference of morphologies can be easily explained by the influence of the molecular weight on the viscosity ratio and therefore, on the critical capillary number. The compatibilizing efficiency of copolymers containing glycidyl methacrylate groups was also addressed in relation to their nature, the protocol for their drying and the molecular weight of the HDPE phase. The increase of adhesion between PET and HDPE was found to have a larger influence on tensile properties than the reduction of interfacial tension. The amount of compatibilizer needed for adhesion improvement depends on the interfacial area that is defined by both the interfacial tension and viscosity ratio of the components. A qualitative relation between the optimum amount of compatibilizer and the critical capillary number can be written. \textcopyright{} 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Appl Polym Sci, 2010},

  abstract = {Additive manufacturing of soft materials requires optimization of printable inks, formulations of these feedstocks, and complex printing processes that must balance a large number of disparate but highly correlated variables. Here, hierarchical machine learning (HML) is applied to 3D printing of silicone elastomer via freeform reversible embedding (FRE), which is challenging because it involves depositing a Newtonian prepolymer liquid phase within a Bingham plastic support bath. The advantage of the HML algorithm is that it can predict the behavior of complex physical systems using sparse data sets through integration of physical modeling in a framework of statistical learning. Here, it is shown that this algorithm can be used to simultaneously optimize material, formulation, and processing variables. The FRE method for 3D printing silicone parts was optimized based on a training set with 38 trial runs. Compared with the previous results from iterative optimization approaches using design-of-experiment and steepest-ascent methods, HML increased printing speed by up to 2.5\,\texttimes\,while retaining print fidelity and also identified a unique silicone formulation and printing parameters that had not been found previously through trial-and-error approaches. These results indicate that HML is an effective tool with the potential for broad application for planning and optimizing in additive manufacturing of soft materials via the FRE method.},

Four kinds of phase structures were formed using different processing methods. As the PET content changes, the best choice of phase structure also changes. When the PP matrix is unoriented, oriented microfibrillar PET can increase the mechanical properties at an appropriate PET content. However, if the PP matrix is an oriented structure (shish-kebab), only the use of unoriented spherical PET can significantly improve the impact strength. Besides this, the compatibilizer polyolefin grafted maleic anhydride (POE-g-MA) can cover the PET in either spherical or microfibrillar shape to form a core\textendash shell structure, which tends to improve both the yield and impact strength. We focused on the influence of all composing aspects\textemdash fibrillation of the dispersed PET, PP matrix crystalline morphology, and compatibilized interface\textemdash on the mechanical properties of PP/PET blends as well as potential synergies between these components. Overall, we provided a theoretical basis for the mechanical recycling of immiscible blends.},

An FGF printer can be fed directly from polymer granules for improved sustainability. Shorter manufacturing routes and the potential of using recycled pellets from waste plastics are key features of FGF in the circular economy framework. A modified version of a standard Prusa i3 plus printer, which was equipped with a Mahor screw extruder, is used to test the mechanical performance of polylactic acid (PLA) processed with different layer infill and printing speed. Rheological and thermal analyses are carried out to characterise the material. The energy consumption of the FGF printer was measured during the fabrication of Dumbbell specimens. Tensile test results are consistent with other investigations presented in the literature. A higher printing speed promotes FGF eco-efficiency without a detrimental effect on the material strength, whereas lower printing speed should be preferred for increased material stiffness.},

Influence of various factors such as the effect of the morphology, CNT composition and the nano compatibilizer effect of CNT on the in-situ reinforced microfibrillar nanocomposites, have been analysed. The dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) showed that the storage modulus microfibrillar composites are precisely related to the fibrils morphology and composition of CNT. It is found that the presence of CNTs on the fibrils surface has improved the storage modulus as well as normalized storage modulus. The results of four probe analysis showed that by increasing CNTs content, the resistivity remarkably decreased with respect to the morphology of the of nanocomposites. Also, scanning electron microscopy images likewise revealed that the preferential localization of MWCNT on to the PET microfibrils enhanced the compatibility between PET fibrils and PP matrix. Hence, The in \textendash situ formation of fibrillar morphology along with MWCNTs is highly useful in terms of mechanical and electrical performance of the resultant nanocomposites. We assume that the optimized results of this work may open an alternative path for the production of commercially important polymer nanocomposite based on the incompatible immiscible blends.},

This process is popular for generating regular products and incorporating innovative designs into the components like auxetic structures, such as fabrication of engineering products, customized implants and sophisticated biomedical devices. Over the years, one of the interesting outputs of this emerging technology is the reuse of waste thermoplastic materials to produce competent products through the fused deposition modeling (FDM) technique. The strength of FDM components produced from thermoplastic waste is lower than that of virgin plastic FDM counterparts. So, there is a need to understand the significant changes in the recycled thermoplastic material during subsequent extrusions, which are chain scission, change in viscosity and breaking strength. The use of additives has been a promising solution to improve the performance of recycled material for 3D printing applications. Hence, this study aims to provide an overview of reusing plastic waste through FDM-based 3D printing. This review summarizes the current knowledge about the effect of processing on thermo-mechanical properties of recycled plastic FDM parts and the use of various additives to improve the overall quality. In addition, two case studies from open literature have been demonstrated to explain the use of FDM and associated technology for plastic recycling.},

  abstract = {Rheological properties related to the extrusion of polyolefins are the shear viscosity, the elongational viscosity, the slip velocity and their temperature- and pressure-dependencies. These properties are measured in the rheology lab mainly via a parallel-plate rheometer and a capillary rheometer. Then appropriate rheological models have to be used to account for all these properties. Such models are either viscous (e.g., the Cross model) or viscoelastic (e.g., the K-BKZ model). The latter gives the best fitting of the experimental data and offers excellent results in numerical simulations, especially in extrusion flows. Wall slip effects are also found and measured by rheometric flows. Modeling of extrusion flows should make use of appropriate slip models that take into effect the various slip parameters, including the effects of shear stress, molecular characteristics, temperature and pressure on the slip velocity. In this paper the importance of these properties in extrusion are discussed.},

  abstract = {A growing number of synthetic plastics derived from fossil fuels are produced, and improper plastic waste management has caused a lot of pollution problems. There are many microplastics in the environment, and they disintegrate slowly in soil and water. The properties of microplastics (MPs) include long residence times, high stability, high fragmentation potential, and the ability to adsorb other contaminants. Invertebrates and planktonic organisms are easily able to accumulate microplastics in aquatic species. Therefore, microplastics (MPs) must be removed from the water and other media. This paper aims to review the occurrence, raw polymers and additives, and remediation methods for removing microplastics from the environment. Several methods are available for removing contaminants, including sorption, filtration and chemical treatments. Various removal methods are discussed along with their methods, efficiency and advantages.},

We demonstrate that our system is capable of reforming ABS plastics found in electronic waste and converting these into functional items through a melt extrusion and additive manufacturing process. We successfully demonstrate the efficacy of the system to operate using solar derived energy and using the resulting filament to 3D print functional pipe connector components. We conclude Ecoprinting holds considerable potential as a sustainable means of converting waste plastics into functional components.

We then characterise the resulting changes in the printing quality and mechanical properties, over a  single recycling cycle. We found that ABS can undergo recycling and reforming into consistent printer  filaments without the addition of virgin material. However, notable changesin polymer characteristics  were observed, reflected by degradation in mechanical properties during tensile tests and a decrease  in the polymer melt flow, which required reduced raster speed to achieve repeatable prints. Despite  these limitations, we demonstrate that recycling and reprinting is possible with acceptable loss of  material integrity, and could provide unique opportunities for sustainable use of waste ABS using 3D  printing technology.},

This makes ABS a prime candidate for the distributed recycling for additive manufacturing (DRAM) approach, which has the potential to increase recycling rates by providing economic incentive for consumers to recycle. For DRAM to be globally applicable, this study investigates the role of the ABS e-waste source and processes to fabricate 3-D printing filament and printed components in both Australia and North America. The study used two different open source extruder systems to convert e-waste into 3D printer filament and for material quality to be assessed through standardized tensile and compression testing. Results revealed a modest reduction in mechanical properties compared to virgin ABS, highlighting the potential for recycled e-waste ABS for consumer and industrial uses. We also show DRAM can significantly reduce 3-D printer filament cost, however, carbon emissions from conversion underscored the need for technical efficiency improvements in electricity generating between countries. Finally, the variations in the properties of the ABS e-waste indicates the need for appropriate labeling of materials in order to advance recycling.},

The regulatory pathway and costs associated with the introduction of bioresorbable materials for TE/RM have proven difficult to overcome, but greater access to 3DP/AM has spurred interest in the processing and availability of existing and new bioresorbable materials.

Recent progress led to low-cost open-source metal 3-D printers using a gas metal arc welding (GMAW)-based print head. This reduced the cost of metal 3-D printers into the range of desktop prosumer polymer 3-D printers. Consequent research established good material properties of metal 3-D printed parts with readily-available weld filler wire, reusable substrates, thermal and stress properties, toolpath planning, bead-width control, mechanical properties, and support for overhangs. These previous works showed that GMAW-based metal 3-D printing has a good adhesion between layers and is not porous inside the printed parts, but they did not proceed far enough to demonstrate applications. In this study, the utility of the GMAW approach to 3-D printing is investigated using a low-cost open-source metal 3-D printer and a converted Computer Numerical Control router machine to make useful parts over a range of applications including: fixing an existing part by adding a 3-D metal feature, creating a product using the substrate as part of the component, 3-D printing in high resolution of useful objects, near net objects, and making an integrated product using a combination of steel and polymer 3-D printing. The results show that GMAW-based 3-D printing is capable of distributed manufacturing of useful products for a wide variety of applications for sustainable development.},

A commercial chain extender (Joncryl ADR 4468) was also used to melt mix with PBT/recycled-PET blend systems. Firstly, Joncryl at different loadings was extruded with recycled-PET to explore the influence of branching on melt behavior and crystallization of PET. The effect of blending recycled-PET with PBT on the final properties was then explored at different blending ratios (25w/75w, 50w/50w and 75w/25w). Similar blends were subsequently prepared while incorporating chain extender. Melt behavior, phase miscibility, crystallization behavior, solid viscoelastic properties, tensile and impact properties of the blends were eventually analyzed using differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), melt flow indexer (MFI), dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA), and tensile and Izod notched impact testing, respectively. The results showed that the addition of chain extender increased the melt viscosity of PET and at the low contents enhanced the PET's crystallization rate. On the other hand, the blends of PBT/recycled-PET are fully miscible in the amorphous region whereas the crystalline phases are immiscible subsequent to a fast cooling. The PBT and PET molecules could also co-crystallize and be fully miscible in crystalline phases upon slow cooling of the melt. Blending recycled-PET with PBT didn't suppress the tensile properties of PBT, however it could enhance the PBT's ductility and reduce its impact strength. The chain extender didn't influence the mechanical properties much.},

  abstract = {Plastic pollution is one of the most pressing global environmental issues we face today, in part due to the continued rise in production and use of disposable plastic products. Polyolefins and polyesters are two of the most prevalent polymers in the world accounting for {$\sim$}80\% of total nonfiber plastic production. Recycling, despite being intrinsically environmentally friendly and sometimes economically viable, remains at a surprisingly low level ({$<$}9\% in the U.S.) with most plastic waste ending up in landfills. One reason for this low rate of recycling stems from the challenge of recycling mixed waste streams and multicomponent plastics. In mixed waste streams, physical presorting of components prior to recycling requires significant effort, which translates to added cost. For multicomponent plastics (e.g., multilayer films such as food wrappers), the individual plastic components cannot be efficiently physically separated, and they are immiscible with poor interfacial adhesion when melt reprocessed. Thus, direct recycling of mixed plastics by melt reprocessing results in products that lack desired end-use properties. In this study, we describe the synthesis of novel poly(ethylene terephthalate)\textendash polyethylene multiblock copolymers (PET\textendash PE MBCPs) and evaluate their utility as adhesive tie layers in multilayer films and compatibilizer additives for melt reprocessed blends. PET and PE are targeted because they are two of the most prevalent commercial polymers in the world and are high volume waste streams. The work described here demonstrates two key findings. First, the PET\textendash PE MBCPs serve as effective adhesive tie layers between neat PET/PE films with adhesive strength comparable to that of commercially available adhesives. Second, PET/PE (80/20 wt \%) blends containing {$\sim$}0.5 wt \% PET\textendash PE MBCP were melt mixed to mimic recycling mixed plastic waste, and they were found to exhibit mechanical properties better than neat PET.

  abstract = {Plastic pollution is one of the most pressing global environmental issues we face today, in part due to the continued rise in production and use of disposable plastic products. Polyolefins and polyesters are two of the most prevalent polymers in the world accounting for {$\sim$}80\% of total nonfiber plastic production. Recycling, despite being intrinsically environmentally friendly and sometimes economically viable, remains at a surprisingly low level ({$<$}9\% in the U.S.) with most plastic waste ending up in landfills. One reason for this low rate of recycling stems from the challenge of recycling mixed waste streams and multicomponent plastics. In mixed waste streams, physical presorting of components prior to recycling requires significant effort, which translates to added cost. For multicomponent plastics (e.g., multilayer films such as food wrappers), the individual plastic components cannot be efficiently physically separated, and they are immiscible with poor interfacial adhesion when melt reprocessed. Thus, direct recycling of mixed plastics by melt reprocessing results in products that lack desired end-use properties. In this study, we describe the synthesis of novel poly(ethylene terephthalate)\textendash polyethylene multiblock copolymers (PET\textendash PE MBCPs) and evaluate their utility as adhesive tie layers in multilayer films and compatibilizer additives for melt reprocessed blends.

  abstract = {Fused Granular Fabrication Additive Manufacturing (FGF AM) has the capability to create tooling that is lower cost than conventionally manufactured tooling and still has sufficient properties for many applications. A vacuum infusion (VI) mold was printed from fiberglass-acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and evaluated for wear and suitability for small VI runs. The mold was designed to accentuate high wear as a ``worst case'' scenario. The mold was able to produce 10 parts successfully before any noticeable change occurred to the surface finish. By 14 parts, the surface finish had roughened sufficiently that demolding was difficult and resulted in damage to the part. Profilometry measurements showed a 7\,\texttimes\,increase in roughness over the run. No significant tool wear or change in geometry was detected. Even longer life would be expected for typical tooling designs since the test mold was deliberately designed to accentuate wear and demolding issues. Based on these results, similar FGF molds are a feasible option for short run VI production for prototyping or low-volume composites manufacturing, possibly at lower cost and quicker turnaround time than machined aluminum molds.},

  abstract = {The problem of designing tablet geometry and its internal structure that results into a specified release profile of the drug during dissolution was considered. A solution method based on parametric programming, inspired by CAD (computer-aided design) approaches currently used in other fields of engineering, was proposed and demonstrated. The solution of the forward problem using a parametric series of structural motifs was first carried out in order to generate a library of drug release profiles associated with each structural motif. The inverse problem was then solved in three steps: first, the combination of basic structural motifs whose superposition provides the closest approximation of the required drug release profile was found by a linear combination of pre-calculated release profiles. In the next step, the final tablet design was constructed and its dissolution curve found computationally. Finally, the proposed design was 3D printed and its dissolution profile was confirmed experimentally. The computational method was based on the numerical solution of drug diffusion in a boundary layer surrounding the tablet, coupled with erosion of the tablet structure encoded by the phase volume function. The tablets were 3D printed by fused deposition modelling (FDM) from filaments produced by hot-melt extrusion. It was found that the drug release profile could be effectively controlled by modifying the tablet porosity. Custom release profiles were obtained by combining multiple porosity regions in the same tablet. The computational method yielded accurate predictions of the drug release rate for both single- and multi-porosity tablets.},

This study gathered data about 91 3D printed projects initiated prior to April 1, 2020, as the virus spread globally. It found that 60\% of products were for personal protective equipment, of which 62\% were 3D printed face shields. Fused filament fabrication was the most common 3D print technology used, and websites were the most popular means of centralising project information. The project data provides objective, quantitative insight balanced with qualitative critical review of the broad trends, opportunities and challenges that could be used by governments, health and medical bodies, manufacturing organisations and the 3D printing community to streamline the current response, as well as plan for future crises using a distributed, flexible manufacturing approach.},

  abstract = {In response to shortages in personal protective equipment (PPE) during the COVID-19 pandemic, makers, community groups and manufacturers around the world utilised 3D printing to fabricate items, including face shields and face masks for healthcare workers and the broader community. In reaction to both local and global needs, numerous designs emerged and were shared online. In this paper, 37 face shields and 31 face masks suitable for fused filament fabrication were analysed from a fabrication perspective, documenting factors such as filament use, time to print and geometric qualities. 3D print times for similar designs varied by several hours, meaning some designs could be produced in higher volumes. Overall, the results show that face shields were approximately twice as fast to 3D print compared to face masks and used approximately half as much filament. Additionally, a face shield typically required 1.5 parts to be 3D printed, whereas face masks required 5 3D printed parts. However, by quantifying the print times, filament use, 3D printing costs, part dimensions, number of parts and total volume of each design, the wide variations within each product category could be tracked and evaluated. This data and objective analysis will help makers, manufacturers, regulatory bodies and researchers consolidate the 3D printing response to COVID-19 and optimise the ongoing strategy to combat supply chain shortages now and in future healthcare crises.},

The ratio of the two components was changed in small increments to track phase inversion. The rheology measurements show that SEBS-g-MA acts differently on HDPE and PET, as different morphologies are formed due to viscosity ratio change. With the help of electron microscopy various phases after extrusion and after injection moulding were revealed and identified. Because of the high viscosity of HDPE the co-continuous morphology was immediately formed when PET reached 30 vol\%. The range of the co-continuous structure of the blend was wider when SEBS-g-MA was added, and the elongation at break also improved as additive content increased, without a significant strength decrease. The divergence of the mechanical properties from the theoretical value, i.e. the value determined by the mixing rule, can be explained by the changing phase structure},

In this study, mechanical recycling of high density polyethylene (HDPE) was simulated by one-hundred (100) consecutive extrusions cycles. During extrusion, processability of virgin HDPE and its recyclates was studied by recording the processing conditions, i.e.~melt pressure and extrusion torque, while after preparation of the recyclates, melt flow index measurements (MFI), small amplitude oscillatory shear tests (rheological properties), and differential scanning calorimetry measurements (DSC) of thermal properties were performed. Also, mechanical properties in solid state were characterized in terms of hardness and modulus measured by nanoindentation, and finally, shear creep compliance was measured to characterize the materials' time-dependent mechanical properties and its durability in solid state. In addition, gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and solubility tests were implemented to study changes in the material structure. The results on rheological and MFI measurements indicate significant structural changes in the material that occurred during the first 30 extrusion cycles. Those changes affect material processability which is as well supported by the recorded processing pressure and torque. On the other hand, processing did not significantly affect material thermal properties. Results on hardness and modulus show deterioration of the material mechanical properties after 10th reprocessing cycle. Similarly, shear creep compliance measurements showed an unfavourable effect of mechanical recycling on the time-dependent mechanical properties, particularly after the 30th extrusion cycle. In addition, results suggested chain branching as a dominating mechanism through first 30 extrusion cycles, domination of chain scission afterwards and also presence of cross-linking after 60th extrusion cycle.},

Hot-melt extrusion was utilized to produce drug-loaded feedstock material that was subsequently 3D-printed into 6, 8, and 10\,\texttimes\,2.5~mm tablets with 15\% and 90\% infill levels. The prepared formulations contained 30\% (w/w) isoniazid in combination with one or multiple pharmaceutical polymers possessing suitable properties for oral drug delivery. Thirteen formulations were successfully hot-melt extruded of which eight had properties suitable for fused deposition modeling 3D printing. Formulations containing HPC were found to be superior regarding printability in this study. Filaments with a breaking distance below 1.5~mm were observed to be too brittle to be fed into the printer. In addition, filaments with high moisture uptake at high relative humidity generally failed to be printable. Different release profiles for the 3D-printed tablets were obtained as a result of using different polymers in the printed formulations. For 8~mm tablets printed with 90\% infill, 80\% isoniazid release was observed between 40 and 852~min. Drug release characteristics could further be altered by changing the infill or the size of the printed tablets allowing personalization of the tablets. This study presents novel formulations containing isoniazid for prevention of latent tuberculosis and investigates 3D printing technology for personalized production of oral solid dosage forms enabling adjustable dose and drug release properties.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Individualizing gastric-resistant tablets is associated with major challenges for clinical staff in hospitals and healthcare centres. This work aims to fabricate gastric-resistant 3D printed tablets using dual FDM 3D printing. METHODS: The gastric-resistant tablets were engineered by employing a range of shell-core designs using polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and methacrylic acid co-polymer for core and shell structures respectively. Filaments for both core and shell were compounded using a twin-screw hot-melt extruder (HME). CAD software was utilized to design a capsule-shaped core with a complementary shell of increasing thicknesses (0.17, 0.35, 0.52, 0.70 or 0.87~mm). The physical form of the drug and its integrity following an FDM 3D printing were assessed using x-ray powder diffractometry (XRPD), thermal analysis and HPLC. RESULTS: A shell thickness {$\geq$}0.52~mm was deemed necessary in order to achieve sufficient core protection in the acid medium. The technology proved viable for incorporating different drug candidates; theophylline, budesonide and diclofenac sodium. XRPD indicated the presence of theophylline crystals whilst budesonide and diclofenac sodium remained amorphous in the PVP matrix of the filaments and 3D printed tablets. Fabricated tablets demonstrated gastric resistant properties and a pH responsive drug release pattern in both phosphate and bicarbonate buffers. CONCLUSIONS: Despite its relatively limited resolution, FDM 3D printing proved to be a suitable platform for a single-process fabrication of delayed release tablets. This work reveals the potential of dual FDM 3D printing as a unique platform for personalising delayed release tablets to suit an individual patient's needs.},

  abstract = {A silane coupling agent (SCA) was used as a compatibilizer for polypropylene\textendash poly(ethylene teraphthalate) (PP\textendash PET) blends with 20, 40, 50, and 60\% PET compositions by weight. PP\textendash PET mixtures were blended with and without an SCA by a single-screw extruder. The effect of silane modification on the tensile and impact properties of the blends was investigated. The morphology and thermal behavior of the blends were examined with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), respectively. The presence of the SCA used in this work extensively improved the mechanical properties of the blends. Mechanical properties were found to be highly dependent on the numbers of extrusions. SEM studies showed that substantially different morphology with better adhesion existed when SCA-treated blends were compared to nontreated PP\textendash PET blends. The presence of individual melting temperatures of the polymers in all compositions with no significant Tm depression indicated that PET and PP were crystallized separately. \textcopyright{} 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

As technology is still emerging, several approaches exist in the literature for quantifying and improving mechanical properties. In this study, we investigate characterizing materials' response of additive manufactured structures, specifically by fused deposition modeling (FDM). A comparative analysis is achieved for four different tensile test specimens for polymers based on ASTM D3039 and ISO 527-2 standards. Comparison of specimen geometries is studied with the aid of computations based on the Finite Element Method (FEM). Uniaxial tensile tests are carried out, after a careful examination of different slicing approaches for 3D printing. We emphasize the effects of the chosen slicer parameters on the position of failures in the specimens and propose a simple formalism for measuring effective mechanical properties of 3D-printed structures.},

Owing to the continuous diffusion of 3D printing driven by low-cost entry-level material extrusion printers, sustainability of a so popular AM technology is of paramount importance. Therefore, recycling 3D printed wastes and 3D parts again at the end of their life is an important issue to be addressed.

The resulting blends were characterized by means of scanning electron microscopy, thermal analysis and testing of mechanical properties. The results show the compatibilizing effects of the three PP grafts are very different and strongly dependent on the functional groups present. Compatibilizer C-4 produced the finest dispersed phase morphology, whereas C-3 showed little compatibilizing effect. Substitution of 40wt.\% of C-2A with a tert-butyl phenolic resin further improved the compatibilizing effect and resulted in much finer domains of the dispersed phase. Modulated-temperature differential scanning calorimetry (M-TDSC) determination revealed that the glass transition (Tg), crystalline temperature (Tc), melting temperature (Tm), and enthalpy of crystallization ({$\Delta$}Hc) of the PET component all declined to some extent by comparison with neat PET. The increment of heat capacity at the glass transition, {$\Delta$}Cp, was found to be changed by the compatibilizers and displayed a trend in very good agreement with that of the morphology, as well as with the mechanical properties. The decrease in the {$\Delta$}Cp value may be used as a new parameter for quantitative estimation of the extent of compatibilization, as the decrease in {$\Delta$}Cp is related to the increase of interface content.},

  abstract = {High-speed 3D printing has recently gained much interest due to its potentials in improving efficiency of fabricating complex geometry components and applications in large-scale additive manufacturing (AM). In this study, a parametric study is performed experimentally to investigate factors affecting high-speed 3D printing of continuous carbon fiber reinforced composites (CFRCs), including material deposition rate, print (nozzle traverse) speed, and nozzle tilt angle based on a novel multi-axis AM approach. The method uses thermoplastic pellets and continuous carbon fiber tows as feedstock materials. The obtained sample quality and mechanical properties are investigated with respect to deposition rate, print speed, and nozzle tilt angle. The fiber impregnation quality is examined through microstructure analysis and correlated with the process conditions and mechanical properties. Increasing deposition rate and tilt angle both improve fiber impregnation quality, enabling implementation of higher print speed and yielding improved mechanical properties. This, combined with demonstrations of printed complex geometry components, shows the great potentials of the proposed method for AM of continuous CFRCs at high speeds. The results of this study also provide further guidance on design and manufacturing of large-volume, high-strength CFRCs through 3D printing.},

Recent developments in 3D printing methods of fiber reinforced polymers, namely, fused deposition modeling (FDM), laminated object manufacturing (LOM), stereolithography (SL), extrusion, and selective laser sintering (SLS) are reviewed in this study to understand the trends and future directions in the respective areas. In addition to extra strength, fibers have also been used in 4D printing to control and manipulate the change of shape or swelling after 3D printing, right out of the printing bed. Although AM of fiber/polymer composites are increasingly developing and under intense attention, there are some issues needed to be addressed including void formation, poor adhesion of fibers and matrix, blockage due to filler inclusion, increased curing time, modelling, simulation, etc. Nonetheless, numerous innovative techniques were spotted amongst recent work trying to overcome these challenges with new material or manufacturing techniques.},

The thermal properties of the PET/PP blend mixed with EAG were measured using DSC, and the results showed that EAG affected melting point and crystallization temperature of the blend polymer. As blend ratio of PP increased, specific gravity of blend fiber reduced and thermal shrinkage rate increased. Blend ratio of PP was greater for shorter lengths of initial curl, although curl loosening increased as time elapsed.},

Circular economy has been proposed as a potential solution by using materials and energy through multiple phases in a recycling flow. However, most of the studies present in the literature of plastic recycling and other wastes are mainly focused on large centralized networks that try to efficiently carry their costs and / or income. In addition, particularly the centralized plastic recycling networks should face the challenge of collection and transportation for high volume and low weight polymers, affecting its economic feasibility. The emergence and development of Open-source technologies such as 3D printing extrusion and other devices provide an opportunity to explore distributed recycling as an alternative option. Under this distributed model, users will collect domestic plastic waste themselves, which can be recycled at their nearest recycling points, such as FabLabs, in order to produce 3D plastic filament and thus contribute to the Circular Economy by reducing the plastic waste. On despite its attractiveness, the complexity of this distributed approach represents a limit to this application. Moreover, the environmental and economical effectiveness still needs to be demonstrated. In this article, a conceptual model is developed and proposed for the collection process in a Closed Loop Supply Chain (CLSC) network of local and distributed plastic recycling in order to analyze its economic and environmental feasibility.},

In addition, particularly the centralized plastic recycling networks should face the challenge of collection and transportation for high volume and low weight polymers, affecting its economic feasibility. The emergence and development of Open-source technologies such as 3D printing extrusion and other devices provide an opportunity to explore distributed recycling as an alternative option. Under this distributed model, users will collect domestic plastic waste themselves, which can be recycled at their nearest recycling points, such as FabLabs, in order to produce 3D plastic filament and thus contribute to the Circular Economy by reducing the plastic waste.},

  abstract = {Two ways of recovering the properties of the scrap plastics poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) were analyzed: (1) blending incompletely segregated polymers with a compatibilizer and (2) blending nonsegregated polymers with a small amount (2 pph) of another compatibilizer. The advancement of the compatibilization reaction in a twin-screw extruder depended on the residence time and intensity of mixing according to melt viscosity measurements and scanning electron microscopy observations. The acceptable mechanical properties for systems with different PET contents were obtained in blends compatibilized with ethylene\textendash glycidyl methacrylate (EGMA) and styrene\textendash ethylene\textendash butylene\textendash styrene grafted with maleic anhydride. For a blend with 75\% PET and 25\% HDPE, the optimum content of EGMA was determined to be about 4 pph, and a film was produced with this composition. Admixtures present in recycled HDPE migrated to PET during blending and accelerated the hydrolysis of PET. As a result of migration, differences in the mechanical properties of the blends were observed, depending on the brand of recycled HDPE used. EGMA was also successfully used for the improvement of mechanical properties of a nonsegregated mixture based on PET. Tensile properties of two compatibilized PET-rich and HDPE-rich commingled scraps indicated the possibility of using these blends for film extrusion, with potential applications in the packaging of technical products. \textcopyright{} 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

For example, 3-D printable reactionware devices offer the opportunity to combine open hardware microfluidic handling with lab-on-a-chip reactionware to radically reduce costs and increase the number and complexity of microfluidic applications. To further drive down the cost while improving the performance of lab-on-a-chip paper-based microfluidic prototyping, this study reports on the development of a RepRap upgrade capable of converting a Prusa Mendel RepRap into a wax 3-D printer for paper-based microfluidic applications. An open-source hardware approach is used to demonstrate a 3-D printable upgrade for the 3-D printer, which combines a heated syringe pump with the RepRap/Arduino 3-D control. The bill of materials, designs, basic assembly, and use instructions are provided, along with a completely free and open-source software tool chain. The open-source hardware device described here accelerates the potential of the nascent field of electrochemical detection combined with paper-based microfluidics by dropping the marginal cost of prototyping to nearly zero while accelerating the turnover between paper-based microfluidic designs.},

The results show that the majority of the actual medical products have some open source development, however, only 15\% of the supporting technologies required to produce them are freely available. The results show there is still considerable research needed to provide open source paths for the development of all the medical hardware needed during pandemics. Five core areas of future research are discussed, which include (i) technical development of a wide-range of open source solutions for all medical supplies and devices, (ii) policies that protect the productivity of laboratories, makerspaces, and fabrication facilities during a pandemic, as well as (iii) streamlining the regulatory process, (iv) developing Good-Samaritan laws to protect makers and designers of open medical hardware, as well as to compel those with knowledge that will save lives to share it, and (v) requiring all citizen-funded research to be released with free and open source licenses.},

  abstract = {Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) threatens to overwhelm our medical infrastructure at the regional level causing spikes in mortality rates because of shortages of critical equipment, like ventilators. Fortunately, with the recent development and widespread deployment of small-scale manufacturing technologies like RepRap-class 3-D printers and open source microcontrollers, mass distributed manufacturing of ventilators has the potential to overcome medical supply shortages. In this study, after providing a background on ventilators, the academic literature is reviewed to find the existing and already openly-published, vetted designs for ventilators systems. These articles are analyzed to determine if the designs are open source both in spirit (license) as well as practical details (e.g. possessing accessible design source files, bill of materials, assembly instructions, wiring diagrams, firmware and software as well as operation and calibration instructions). Next, the existing Internet and gray literature are reviewed for open source ventilator projects and designs. The results of this review found that the tested and peer-reviewed systems lacked complete documentation and the open systems that were documented were either at the very early stages of design (sometimes without even a prototype) and were essentially only basically tested (if at all). With the considerably larger motivation of an ongoing pandemic, it is assumed these projects will garner greater attention and resources to make significant progress to reach a functional and easily-replicated system. There is a large amount of future work needed to move open source ventilators up to the level considered scientific-grade equipment, and even further work needed to reach medical-grade hardware. Future work is needed to achieve the potential of this approach by developing policies, updating regulations, and securing funding mechanisms for the development and testing of open source ventilators for both the current COVID19 pandemic as well as for future pandemics and for everyday use in low-resource settings.},

With over 2 million desktop 3-D printers being purchased per year, the impact on the existing industry could be substantial, but is still unknown. To begin to determine the economic impact created by proliferation of open source digital designs for 3-D printed products, this study analyzes the top 100 most popular designs posted on the YouMagine repository. The download substitution value is calculated based on Amazon prices of comparable products to estimate the potential savings those designs could generate. Case studies are provided on open source equivalent products, non-commercial products of high value to the consumer, and products for 3-D printing users. The means of percentage savings using commercial filament, commercial pellets, recycled commercial pellets, and self-recycled consumer plastics are 82\%, 94\%, 97\% and 98\%, respectively. The potential for laterally-scaled wealth generation in a circular economy with recyclebots, 3-D printing and sharing open designs in the US from household plastic waste is over \$359 billion/year for offset filament purchases or over \$7 trillion/year for products. If adoption of household-level DIY digital manufacturing of open source designs becomes widespread open business models are needed.},

  abstract = {A polymer blend with high extensibility, exhibiting both shape memory and self-healing, was 4D printed using a low-cost fused filament fabrication (FFF, or fused deposition modeling, FDM) 3D printer. The material is composed of two commercially available commodity polymers, polycaprolactone (PCL), a semi-crystalline thermoplastic, and polystyrene-block-poly(ethylene-co-butylene)-block-polystyrene (SEBS), a thermoplastic elastomer. The shape memory and self-healing properties of the blends were studied systematically through thermo-mechanical and morphological characterization, providing insight into the shape memory mechanism useful for tuning the material properties. In 3D-printed articles, the orientation of the semi-crystalline and micro-phase-separated domains leads to improvement of the shape memory property and extensibility of this material compared to compression-molded samples. By controlling the orientation of the printed fibers, we achieved a high strain at break over 1200\%, outperforming previously reported flexible 4D-printed materials. The self-healing agent, PCL, enables the material to heal scratches and cracks and adhere two surfaces after annealing at 80 \textdegree C for 30 min. The high performance, multi-functionality, and potential scalability make it a promising candidate for a broad spectrum of applications, including flexible electronics, soft actuators, and deployable devices.},

This study serves as a representative model for the potential future of 3-D printing in the average American household by employing a printer operator who was relatively unfamiliar with 3-D printing and the 3-D design files of common items normally purchased by the average consumer. Twenty-six items were printed in thermoplastic and a cost analysis was performed through comparison to comparable, commercially available products at a low and high price range. When compared to the low-cost items, investment in a 3-D printer represented a return of investment of over 100\% in five years. The simple payback time for the high-cost comparison was less than 6 months, and produced a 986\% return. Thus, fully-assembled commercial open source 3-D printers can be highly profitable investments for American consumers. Finally, as a preliminary gauge of the effect that widespread prosumer use of 3-D printing might have on the economy, savings were calculated based on the items' download rates from open repositories. Results indicate that printing these selected items have already saved prosumers over \$4 million by substituting for purchases.},

The resuscitation system is based on the Arduino controller with a real-time operating system installed on a largely RepRap 3-D printable parametric component-based structure. The cost of the materials for the system is under \$170, which makes it affordable for replication by makers around the world. The device provides a controlled breathing mode with tidal volumes from 100 to 800~mL, breathing rates from 5 to 40 breaths/minute, and inspiratory-to-expiratory ratio from 1:1 to 1:4. The system is designed for reliability and scalability of measurement circuits through the use of the serial peripheral interface and has the ability to connect additional hardware due to the object-oriented algorithmic approach. Experimental results after testing on an artificial lung for peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), respiratory rate (RR), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), tidal volume, proximal pressure, and lung pressure demonstrate repeatability and accuracy exceeding human capabilities in BVM-based manual ventilation. Future work is necessary to further develop and test the system to make it acceptable for deployment outside of emergencies such as with COVID-19 pandemic in clinical environments, however, the nature of the design is such that desired features are relatively easy to add using protocols and parametric design files provided.},

  abstract = {The effect of CaCO3 on the mechanical properties of polyethylene terephthalate/polypropylene (PET/PP) blends with styrene-ethylene/butylene-styrene (SEBS) as a compatibilizer was investigated. Samples with different compositions of PET/PP/CaCO3 blend were prepared by injection molding method with CaCO3 content of 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 wt\%. The ratio of PET/PP was fixed at 90/10, while compatibilizer SEBS had a fixed ratio of 5\%. The samples were formed according to the ASTM D638, ASTM D790, and ISO 868 standards. The results show that adding 2\% of CaCO3 helps to improve the mechanical properties of the plastic sample. Specifically, tensile strength and the flexural strength increase as CaCO3 increases from 0 to 2\%. With 2\% of CaCO3, the tensile strength and the flexural strength gain the highest value of 34.79 MPa, and 60.59 MPa, respectively. However, if the sample content is more than 4\% CaCO3, both the tensile strength and the flexural strength will experience a decline as the percentage of CaCO3 rises. The SEM microstructure indicates that CaCO3 particles are well dispersed on the PET substrate. Additionally, the number of particles increases when enhancing the CaCO3 content in the blends.},

  abstract = {Since this advent, additive manufacturing (AM) has grown steadily and found applications across all types of sectors. While the great development of such technologies has improved the quality of prints and expanded the availability of materials, AM still has some limitations regarding its physical scaling. This paper will briefly present the state-of-the-art of large-scale additive manufacturing and subsequently greater attention will be given to extrusion-based 3D printing. Specifically, we will discuss about large format additive manufacturing (LFAM) or big area additive manufacturing (BAAM), a technology based on material extrusion born a few years ago. These systems are characterized by higher deposition rate and lower costs of the material compared to fused filament fabrication (FFF) printers; moreover, they allow to obtain parts with better properties (e.g., adding carbon or glass fibers). The world of research has shown great interest in large-scale material extrusion technologies, which appear to be quite competitive with conventional manufacturing processes and which will find increasing application in the industrial field. With the aim of developing a tool for orienting researchers and technicians in this complex field, the present paper presents a systematic review of the actual market of machines, the research in extrudable materials and related applications concerning large-scale 3D printing, and in particular the LFAM.},

  abstract = {The present study aimed to analyze how the printing process affects the final state of a printed pharmaceutical product and to establish prediction models for post-printing characteristics according to basic printing settings. To do this, a database was constructed through analysis of products elaborated with a distinct printing framework. The polymers acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polylactic acid (PLA), and high-impact polystyrene (HIPS) were tested in a statistically-based experiment to define the most critical printing factors for mass, mass variation, printing time, and porosity. Then, a predictive model equation was established and challenged to determine two different medical prescriptions. The factors of size scale, printlet format, and print temperature influenced printlet mass, while the printing time was impacted by size scale, printing speed, and layer height. Finally, increased printing speed leads to more porous printlets. The prescript-printed tablets showed average mass, mass variations, and porosity close to theoretical values for all filaments, which supports the adequacy of the optimized design of experiments for tablet production. Hence, printing settings can be preselected according to the desired product's characteristics, resulting in tablets produced with higher precision than usually achieved by compounding pharmacies.},

In extrusion-based printing, materials are used for applications that range from cell free printing to cell-laden bioinks that mimic natural tissues. Beyond single tissue applications, multi-material extrusion based printing has recently been developed to manufacture scaffolds that mimic tissue interfaces. Despite these advances, some material limitations prevent wider adoption of the extrusion-based 3D printers currently available. This progress report provides an overview of this commonly used printing strategy, as well as insight into how this technique can be improved. As such, it is hoped that the prospective report guides the inclusion of more rigorous material characterization prior to printing, thereby facilitating cross-platform utilization and reproducibility.},

In an extruder, the polymer powders were mixed with maleic anhydride-grafted polypropylene (MAPP) and polyethylene wax (PE wax) as a compatibilizer and a processing aid, respectively. The extrudates were prepared into test specimens by injection molding. Physical properties of PP/rPET blends were subsequently investigated. The results pointed out that, for the pulverized blends without compatibilizer, tensile and flexural strength were improved at the lower amount of rPET. The compatibilizing effect of MAPP was exhibited at the higher amount of rPET. The reduction of melt flow index (MFI) may cause difficulties for some processing techniques which required polymers with high MFI. The addition of PE wax successfully brought up the MFI as well as elongation at break while other mechanical properties decreased.},

Graduated compression stockings have become popular among runners in the last years and their use may influence the athlete's thermoregulation. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of graduated compression stockings on skin temperature during running in a moderate indoor environment. Forty-four runners performed two running tests lasting 30min (10min of warm-up and 20min at 75\% of their maximal aerobic speed) with and without graduated compressive stockings. Skin temperature was measured in 12 regions of interest on the lower limb by infrared thermography before and after running. Heart rate and perception of fatigue were assessed during the last minute of the running test. Compression stockings resulted in greater increase of temperature (p=0.002 and ES=2.2, 95\% CI [0.11\textendash 0.45\textdegree C]) not only in the body regions in contact (tibialis anterior, ankle anterior and gastrocnemius) but also in the body regions that were not in contact with the garment (vastus lateralis, abductor and semitendinosus). No differences were observed between conditions in heart rate and perception of fatigue (p{$>$}0.05 and ES{$<$}0.8). In conclusion, running with graduated compression stockings produces a greater increase of skin temperature without modifying the athlete's heart rate and perception of fatigue.},

  abstract = {Simultaneous toughening and reinforcing of immiscible blend system is one of the main obstacles to mechanical recycling of polyethylene (PE)-based mixed waste. To address the challenge, this study proposed a low-cost processing strategy combining volume-pulsatile injection molding (VPIM) and thermal annealing to prepare microfibrillar composite, which constructs and optimizes oriented spherical crystal structure that has never been reported before. Under the synergistic effect of VPIM and annealing, both self-toughening and self-reinforcing of immiscible HDPE/PET composite are realized simply and cost-effectively. The impact strength, yield strength, and tensile modulus of VPIM-An samples are increased by 3220\%, 32\%, and 39.73\%, respectively, compared with those of CIM samples. According to phase and crystal morphologies, PET submicron-fibrils, satisfactory interfacial adhesion, oriented spherical crystals with aligned thick lamellae inside, and interlinked microstruc\- ture are responsible for the remarkable enhancement in mechanical properties. These analysis results are sup\- ported by the evidence from DSC, DMA, impact-fractured surface morphology, 2D-WAXD, and 2D-SAXS. The synergistic effect mechanism of VPIM and annealing is proposed to uncover that oriented spherical crystal structure is composed of hybrid shish-kebabs with multiple shish and is endowed with interlinked characteristics. This paper enriches the structure control of immiscible polymer blends and paves a new avenue toward additivefree recycling of plastic waste.},

A single leg bending (SLB) specimen made of Polylactic acid (PLA) and Nylon is loaded under the quasi-static three-point bending condition to initiate the fracture between the PLA/Nylon interface. Six different process parameters (bed temperature, printing temperature, printing speed, printing orientation, layer height, and thickness ratio) are considered to investigate the fracture toughness. It is observed that process parameters have a significant impact on the bi-material interfacial fracture toughness. Due to the increase of crystallinity of the polymer, the fracture toughness decreases by about 40\% when the bed temperature increases from 60 \textdegree C to 100 \textdegree C. However, with improved molecular diffusion, the fracture toughness is enhanced by 95\% with the increase of the printing temperature. Although printing speed has not any significant impact on fracture toughness, thinner layers provide a better bond strength and polymer wetting, resulting in a higher fracture initiation toughness compared to thicker layers. Due to the presence of extra voids and anisotropic behavior, the specimens of 0o/90o raster-orientation demonstrate about 75\% lower fracture toughness compared to those of +45o/-45o orientated specimens.},

  abstract = {Open-source 3D printers mean objects can be quickly and efficiently produced. However, design and fabrication parameters need to be optimized to set up the correct printing procedure; a procedure in which the characteristics of the printing materials selected for use can also influence the process. This work focuses on optimizing the printing process of the open-source 3D extruder machine RepRap, which is used to manufacture poly(\&epsilon;-caprolactone) (PCL) scaffolds for cell culture applications. PCL is a biocompatible polymer that is free of toxic dye and has been used to fabricate scaffolds, i.e., solid structures suitable for 3D cancer cell cultures. Scaffold cell culture has been described as enhancing cancer stem cell (CSC) populations related to tumor chemoresistance and/or their recurrence after chemotherapy. A RepRap BCN3D+ printer and 3 mm PCL wire were used to fabricate circular scaffolds. Design and fabrication parameters were first determined with SolidWorks and Slic3r software and subsequently optimized following a novel sequential flowchart. In the flowchart described here, the parameters were gradually optimized step by step, by taking several measurable variables of the resulting scaffolds into consideration to guarantee high-quality printing. Three deposition angles (45\&deg;, 60\&deg; and 90\&deg;) were fabricated and tested. MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells and NIH/3T3 murine fibroblasts were used to assess scaffold adequacy for 3D cell cultures. The 60\&deg; scaffolds were found to be suitable for the purpose. Therefore, PCL scaffolds fabricated via the flowchart optimization with a RepRap 3D printer could be used for 3D cell cultures and may boost CSCs to study new therapeutic treatments for this malignant population. Moreover, the flowchart defined here could represent a standard procedure for non-engineers (i.e., mainly physicians) when manufacturing new culture systems is required.},

Combinations of a commercial modifier with pentaerythritol were also successfully employed to cause simultaneous hyperbranching and controlled chain scission, thereby modifying the melt rheology of the material without excessively increasing the molecular weight, as highlighted by common technological melt viscosity measurements such as online torque and off-line melt flow rate (MFR). Since the high melt fluidity of PET plays a critical role on its flame resistance, the combined effect of chain extenders and halogen-free phosphorated additives on the fire resistance of the modified toughened blends was also investigated. Preliminary results indicate that the chemical reactions among polymer and additives must be taken into careful account to prevent unfavorable effects on the ultimate melt rheology and mechanical properties. \textcopyright{} 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

After two research trials and one large-scale industrial trial, an upcycling formulation was determined to bring the recyclate to the required level of the new application, thus closing this specific material loop within the case company. The used methodology adheres to the Design from Recycling principle, in which industrially available (mechanically) recycled polymer materials are matched to potential new products. The design strategy starts from either the properties of an available recycled polymer (and then defines the product) or from the functional boundary conditions of the product (and then selects the material and/or an optional material upcycling step).

  abstract = {Machine learning (ML) and three-dimensional (3D) printing are among the fastest-growing branches of science. While ML can enable computers to independently learn from available data to make decisions with minimal human intervention, 3D printing has opened up an avenue for modern, multi-material, manufacture of complex 3D structures with a rapid turn-around ability for users with limited manufacturing experience. However, the determination of optimum printing parameters is still a challenge, increasing pre-printing process time and material wastage. Here, we present the first integration of ML and 3D printing through an easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI) for printing parameter optimization. Unlike the widely held orthogonal design used in most of the 3D printing research, we, for the first time, used nine different computer-aided design (CAD) images and in order to enable ML algorithms to distinguish the difference between designs, we devised a self-designed method to calculate the ``complexity index'' of CAD designs. In addition, for the first time, the similarity of the print outcomes and CAD images are measured using four different self-designed labeling methods (both manually and automatically) to figure out the best labeling method for ML purposes. Subsequently, we trained eight ML algorithms on 224 datapoints to identify the best ML model for 3D printing applications. The ``gradient boosting regression'' model yields the best prediction performance with an R-2 score of 0.954. The ML-embedded GUI developed in this study enables users (either skilled or unskilled in 3D printing and/or ML) to simply upload a design (desired to print) to the GUI along with desired printing temperature and pressure to obtain the approximate similarity in the case of actual 3D printing of the uploaded design. This ultimately can prevent error-and-trial steps prior to printing which in return can speed up overall design-to-end-product time with less material waste and more cost-efficiency.},

The composition of the blend is varied by altering the level of loading of a two-phase compatibilizer. The composition with 7 wt\% loading of compatibilizer showed improved properties than the neat blend. Tensile strength and elongation at break (\%) improvement of 117\% and 485\%, respectively reflected in the composition containing 7 wt\% of ionomer as a compatibilizer on comparing with 0 wt\% of ionomer, making them ideal composition. The compatibilization and improved mechanical performances were supported by nanometric level phase morphological characteristics. The stability and thermal degradation of the compositions are discussed through thermal analysis. Comparative study on repeated processing up to three cycles and their compatibilization mechanism based on polarity has been reported here.},

Here, in this work, the research efforts have been made to optimize the FDM process parameters in order to find out the best parameter setting as per the mechanical and surface quality perspectives by using hybrid particle swarm and bacterial foraging optimization (PSO\textendash BFO) evolutionary algorithm. Taguchi L18 orthogonal array was used for the development of acro-nitrile butadiene styrene based 3D components by considering layer thickness, support material, model interior and orientation as a process parameters. Further, the relationships among selected FDM process parameters and output responses such as hardness, flexural modulus, tensile strength and surface roughness were established by using linear multiple regression. Then, the effects of individual process parameters on selected response parameters were examined by signal to noise ratio plots. Finally, a multi-objective optimization of process parameters has been performed with hybrid PSO\textendash BFO, general PSO and BFO algorithm, respectively. The overall results reveal that the layer thickness of 0.007 mm, support material type sparse, part orientation of 60\$\$\{\^\textbackslash circ \}\$\$and model interior of high density helps in achieving desired performance level.},

If these trends continue, carbon emissions from plastic wastes would reach 15~\% of global carbon budgets by 2050. An approach to reducing plastic waste is to use distributed recycling for additive manufacturing (DRAM) where virgin plastic products are replaced by locally manufactured recycled plastic products that have no transportation-related carbon emissions. Unfortunately, the design of most 3-D printers forces an increase in the machine cost to expand for recycling plastic at scale. Recently, a fused granular fabrication (FGF)/fused particle fabrication (FPF) large-scale printer was demonstrated with a GigabotX extruder based on the open source cable driven Hangprinter concept. To further improve that system, here a lower-cost recyclebot direct waste plastic extruder is demonstrated and the full designs, assembly and operation are detailed. The {$<\$$}1,700 machine's accuracy and printing performance are quantified, and the printed parts mechanical strength is within the range of other systems. Along with support from the Hangprinter and DUET3 communities, open hardware developers have a rich ecosystem to modify in order to print directly from waste plastic for DRAM.},

In this study, high molecular weight PL-32 pellets were extruded into {$\sim$}1.7mm diameter PLLA fiber. Melt rheometric data of the PLLA polymer was analyzed and demonstrated pseudo-plastic behavior with a flow index of n=0.465 ({$<$}1). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was conducted using samples from the extruded fiber to obtain thermal properties. DSC of the 3D printed struts was also analyzed to assess changes in thermal properties due to FFF. The DSC and rheometric analysis results were subsequently used to define appropriate FFF process parameters. Constant porosity scaffolds were FFF 3D printed with 4 distinct laydown patterns; 0/90\textdegree{} rectilinear (control), 45/135\textdegree{} rectilinear, Archimedean chords, and honeycomb using the in-house developed custom multi-modality 3D bioprinter (CMMB). The effect of laydown pattern on scaffold bulk erosion (weight loss) was studied by immersion in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) over a 6-month period and measured monthly. A repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to identify statistically significant differences between mean percent weight loss of the four laydown patterns at each time point (1\textendash 6 months). The resulting data follows distinct temporal trends, but no statistically significant differences between means at individual time points were found. Cross-sectional scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the 6-month degraded scaffolds showed noticeable structural deterioration. The study demonstrates successful processing of PLLA fiber from PL-32 pellets and FFF-based 3D printing of bioresorbable scaffolds with pre-defined laydown patterns using medical grade PLLA polymer which could prove beneficial in biomedical applications.},

  abstract = {In order to accelerate deployment of distributed recycling by providing low-cost feed stocks of granulated post-consumer waste plastic, this study analyzes an open source waste plastic granulator system. It is designed, built, and tested for its ability to convert post-consumer waste, 3D printed products and waste into polymer feedstock for recyclebots of fused particle/granule printers. The technical specifications of the device are quantified in terms of power consumption (380 to 404 W for PET and PLA, respectively) and particle size distribution. The open source device can be fabricated for less than \$2000 USD in materials. The experimentally measured power use is only a minor contribution to the overall embodied energy of distributed recycling of waste plastic. The resultant plastic particle size distributions were found to be appropriate for use in both recyclebots and direct material extrusion 3D printers. Simple retrofits are shown to reduce sound levels during operation by 4dB-5dB for the vacuum. These results indicate that the open source waste plastic granulator is an appropriate technology for community, library, maker space, fab lab, or small business\textendash based distributed recycling.},

The mechanical, rheological, thermal, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses were utilized to characterize the samples. The results revealed that both R-HDPE/R-PET and R-HDPE/R-PS blends show phase inversion but at different compositions. The R-PET was found to have much higher influence on the properties enhancement of the R-HDPE compared to R-PS, but at the phase inverted situation, a significant loss in the tensile strength of R-HDPE/R-PET blend was observed due to the weak interaction at this morphological state. However, the ternary blends with higher loading of second phase, namely greater than 50 wt\% of R-PET+R-PS, demonstrated better mechanical properties than the binary blends with the same content of either R-PET or R-PS.

Consequently, the so-called benchmark artifacts are necessary to assess the capabilities and limitations of each AM process or to compare the performance of different processes. This paper focuses on the benchmark artifacts for evaluating the geometrical performance of AM processes and proposes an extensive review of the available literature, analyzing the design of such test parts in detail. The investigated test parts are classified according to the process aspect that they are able to evaluate (dimensional/geometrical accuracy, repeatability, minimum feature size) and the combination AM process/materials for which they have been used. In addition, the paper draws a summary of guidelines to design benchmark artifacts for geometrical performance evaluation.},

  abstract = {Recently, with a broadening range of available materials and alteration of feeding processes, several extrusion-based 3D printing processes for metal materials have been developed. An emerging process is applicable for the fabrication of metal parts into electronics and composites. In this paper, some critical parameters of extrusion-based 3D printing processes were optimized by a series of experiments with a melting extrusion printer. The raw materials were copper powder and a thermoplastic organic binder system and the system included paraffin wax, low density polyethylene, and stearic acid (PW\textendash LDPE\textendash SA). The homogeneity and rheological behaviour of the raw materials, the strength of the green samples, and the hardness of the sintered samples were investigated. Moreover, the printing and sintering parameters were optimized with an orthogonal design method. The influence factors in regard to the ultimate tensile strength of the green samples can be described as follows: infill degree {$>$} raster angle {$>$} layer thickness. As for the sintering process, the major factor on hardness is sintering temperature, followed by holding time and heating rate. The highest hardness of the sintered samples was very close to the average hardness of commercially pure copper material. Generally, the extrusion-based printing process for producing metal materials is a promising strategy because it has some advantages over traditional approaches for cost, efficiency, and simplicity.},

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease, caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, has had a huge impact on our society, including in relation to the continuous supply of personal protective equipment (PPE). The aim of the study is to give a detailed overview of 3D-printed PPE devices and provide practical information regarding the manufacturing and further design process, as well as describing the potential risks of using them. Open-source models of a half-face mask, safety goggles, and a face-protecting shield are evaluated, considering production time, material usage, and cost. Estimations have been performed with fused filament fabrication (FFF) and selective laser sintering (SLS) technology, highlighting the material characteristics of polylactic acid (PLA), polyamide, and a two-compound silicone. Spectrophotometry measurements of transparent PMMA samples were performed to determine their functionality as goggles or face mask parts. All the tests were carried out before and after the tetra-acetyl-ethylene-diamine (TAED)-based disinfection process. The results show that the disinfection has no significant effect on the mechanical and structural stability of the used polymers; therefore, 3D-printed PPE is reusable. For each device, recommendations and possible means of development are explained. The files of the modified models are provided. SLS and FFF additive manufacturing technology can be useful tools in PPE development and small-series production, but open-source models must be used with special care.},

It was extensively used at the beginning for the manufacturing of prototypes, and it has been adopted during the last few years for the manufacturing of fully functional components.

This study is focused on PEEK nanocomposites with different amounts of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) (i.e. 3, 5, 10 wt\%) produced in the form of a filament and successively 3D printed. The influence of the CNT presence on printability was studied and correlated to the nanocomposite feedstock thermal and microstructural properties, defining a substrate temperature processability window. Interestingly the addition of CNTs significantly limits the processability window due to the influence on the crystallization process and viscosity.

  abstract = {The transition toward circular economy models has been progressively promoted in the last few years. Different disciplines and strategies may significantly support this change. Although the specific contribution derived from design, material science, and additive manufacturing is well-established, their interdisciplinary relationship in circular economy contexts is relatively unexplored. This paper aims to review the main case studies related to new circular economy models for waste valorization through extrusion-based additive manufacturing, circular materials, and new design strategies. The general patterns were investigated through a comprehensive analysis of 74 case studies from academic research and design practice in the last six-year period (2015\textendash 2021), focusing on the application fields, the 3D printing technologies, and the materials. Further considerations and future trends were then included by looking at the relevant funded projects and case studies of 2021. A broader number of applications, circular materials, and technologies were explored by the academic context, concerning the practice-based scenario linked to more consolidated fields. Thanks to the development of new strategies and experiential tools, academic research and practice can be linked to foster new opportunities to implement circular economy models.},

The morphology of the blends was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and optical microscopy. The interfacial shear strength between PET and HDPE as well as between the polymers and the glass fiber was determined with microbond testing. The static mechanical properties were defined with tensile tests and Charpy impact tests, while the dynamic mechanical properties with DMTA. In blends that do not contain glass fibers, the co-continuous structure formed in the vicinity of phase inversion increased both the static tensile modulus as well as the impact strength compared to the mechanical properties of polymers. Based on the observations simple morphological models were set up, with the help of which the change in the mechanical properties of blends of different composition can be explained. POLYM.

  abstract = {Plastic packaging typically consists of a mixture of polymers and contains a whole range of components, such as paper, organic residue, halogens, and metals, which pose problems during recycling. Nevertheless, until today, limited detailed data are available on the full polymer composition of plastic packaging waste taking into account the separable packaging parts present in a certain waste stream, nor on their quantitative levels of (elemental) impurities. This paper therefore presents an unprecedented in-depth analysis of the polymer and elemental composition, including C, H, N, S, O, metals, and halogens, of commonly generated plastic packaging waste streams in European sorting facilities. Various analytical techniques are applied, including Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), polarized optical microscopy, ion chromatography, and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), on more than 100 different plastic packaging products, which are all separated into their different packaging subcomponents (e.g., a bottle into the bottle itself, the cap, and the label). Our results show that certain waste streams consist of mixtures of up to nine different polymers and contain various elements of the periodic table, in particular metals such as Ca, Al, Na, Zn, and Fe and halogens like Cl and F, occurring in concentrations between 1 and 3000 ppm. As discussed in the paper, both polymer and elemental impurities impede in many cases closed-loop recycling and require advanced pretreatment steps, increasing the overall recycling cost.},

With any new technology comes new rules and guidelines for the optimal use of said technology. Big Area Additive Manufacturing (BAAM), developed by Cincinnati Incorporated and Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Manufacturing Demonstration Facility, requires a host of new design parameters compared to small-scale 3D printing to create large-scale parts. However, BAAM also creates new possibilities in material testing and various applications in the manufacturing industry. Most of the design constraints of small-scale polymer 3D printers still apply to BAAM. Beyond those constraints, new rules and limitations exist because BAAM's large-scale system significantly changes the thermal properties associated with small-scale AM. This work details both physical and software-related design considerations for additive manufacturing. After reading this guide, one will have a better understanding of slicing software's capabilities and limitations, different physical characteristics of design and how to apply them appropriately for AM, and how to take the inherent nature of AM into consideration during the design process.},

The MMT contents in 90:10 rPET/HDPE and 70:30 rPET/HDPE ranged from 1 to 5 wt.\%. rPET/HDPE nanocomposites were prepared by using a single screw extruder, and injection molded to prepare mechanical test specimens. The samples underwent rheological tests by using a capillary rheometer, and the morphology of the nanocomposites was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The thermal stability of the nanocomposites was tested using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The results showed that MMT acts as compatibilizing agent and improves phase dispersion and interfacial adhesion in the nanocomposites. The maximum tensile strength was found at 3 and 1 wt.\% of MMT for the 90:10 and 70:30 rPET/HDPE blends. However, the tensile modulus decreased significantly with the incorporation of MMT. The impact strength for both the 90:10 and 70:30 blends reached a maximum at 3 wt.\% and started to decrease beyond 3 wt.\%. The incorporation of MMT increased the shear viscosity of the 90:10 and 70:30 blends, which reached a maximum value at 3 and 1 wt.\%. SEM micrographs showed a good interaction of MMT that improved the adhesion between the two phases of blends and led to an increase in the mechanical properties of rPET/HDPE nanocomposites.},

The sorting of plastics is a very essential step in different waste management technique. Manual sorting is suitable when plastic component are present in large amount but it is a labor intensive process. In automated sorting technique NIR(near infrared) offers great advantage among all wave sorting technique but not suited for dark coloured plastic and can be used on transparent bodies. In air sorting lighter particles are separated from heavier ones based on specific gravity. In electrostatic sorting method materials are separated based on electrostatic charge. In float-sink separation technique the plastics are in a fluid that has density in between the materials making it possible for less dense material to float and heavier to sink whereas sorting by selective dissolution is based on batch dissolution of mixed plastics using solvents. Hydrocyclones enhance the difference of specific weight by centrifugal force so materials with little difference can be separated as well. The present paper reviews the available literatures in the area of sorting of plastic waste for effective recycling.},

For example, gel organ models and gel artificial blood vessels are required at a medical site. Also in the field of robotics, soft materials are drawing attention. To put a high-strength gel into practical use, it is necessary to free-form a gel using a 3D gel printer. We developed a 3D gel Printer "SWIM-ER", has enabled modeling of complex shapes of the gel. However, this is expensive. Therefore not all of the gel researchers and the companies have such a device. ``RepRap'' is the abbreviation for ``Replicating rapidly prototyper'', the open source 3D printer. Most of the RepRap parts are made of a resin, and the 3D digital data of the parts and its firmware are posted on the internet. Therefore, we can easily create another 3D printer by building the parts with a 3D printer and programing the firmware on an inexpensive electronic substrate like the ``Arduino''.

If no parts are available, 3D printing can potentially be used to produce time-critical parts on demand such as nasal swabs, face shields, respirators, and spares for ventilators. A structured search using online sources and feedback from key experts in the 3D printing area was applied to highlight critical issues and to suggest potential solutions. The prescribed outcomes were estimated in terms of cost and productivity at a small and large scale. This study analyzes the number and costs of parts that can be manufactured with a single machine within 24 h. It extrapolates this potential with the number of identical 3D printers in the world to estimate the global potential that can help practitioners, frontline workers, and those most vulnerable during the pandemic. It also proposes alternative 3D printing processes and materials that can be applicable.

  abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a surge of demand for medical supplies and spare parts, which has put pressure on the manufacturing sector. As a result, 3D printing communities and companies are currently operating to ease the breakdown in the medical supply chain. If no parts are available, 3D printing can potentially be used to produce time-critical parts on demand such as nasal swabs, face shields, respirators, and spares for ventilators. A structured search using online sources and feedback from key experts in the 3D printing area was applied to highlight critical issues and to suggest potential solutions. The prescribed outcomes were estimated in terms of cost and productivity at a small and large scale. This study analyzes the number and costs of parts that can be manufactured with a single machine within 24 h. It extrapolates this potential with the number of identical 3D printers in the world to estimate the global potential that can help practitioners, frontline workers, and those most vulnerable during the pandemic. It also proposes alternative 3D printing processes and materials that can be applicable. This new unregulated supply chain has also opened new questions concerning medical certification and Intellectual property rights (IPR). There is also a pressing need to develop new standards for 3D printing of medical parts for the current pandemic, and to ensure better national resilience.},

  abstract = {Polymer recycling is a way to reduce environmental impacts of accumulation of polymeric waste materials. However, low recycling rates are often observed in conventional centralized recycling plants mainly to the challenge of collection and transportation for high-volume low-weight-polymers in conventional centralized recycling plants. As the democratization of open-source 3D printers is going forward thanks to initiatives such as FabLab environments, there is a growing interest on how to use this technology to improve the efficiency of use of raw materials. Studies have been proposed in order to recycle waste polymer into open-source 3D printer feedstock. The recycling of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) issued from bottles of used milk jugs through use of an open-source filament fabricator system called RecycleBot has been evaluated. In this study, we propose an evaluation of the mechanical recyclability of Polylactic Acid (PLA), material widely used in the open-source 3D printing context, in order to establish the viability of this recycled material to be used in the open-source 3D printers. The degradation of the material's mechanical and rheological properties after a number of cycles of multiple extrusion and printing processes is evaluated. The characterization of recycled raw materials for open-source 3D printing has implications not only to reduce the environmental impact of polymers waste, but also it will allow us to understand the technical requirements and challenges for development of open-source filament recycle machine/process. The coupling of open-source 3D printers and filament extruders can offer the bases of a new distributed polymer recycling paradigm, which reverses the traditional paradigm of centralizing recycling of polymers where is often uneconomic and energy intensive due to transportation embodied energy. Moreover, this characterization also will allow the exploration of new source of materials and new composite materials for open-source 3D printing, in order to improve the quality of products made by this technology.},

In this work, the effect of pressure and shear flow on the crystallization process of polypropylene-based nanocomposites and polypropylene/polyethylene terephthalate PBNANOs have been studied employing dilatometry (PVT), X-ray, rheology, and DSC. The material systems used allow studying the effect of shear in the presence of nanoparticles that do not have a nucleating effect, as well as the combined effect of shear and nucleating nanoparticles. Nucleating nanoparticles increase the crystallization temperature more significantly because of the combined effect of nucleation and flow. For carbon nanotubes, nucleation is more pronounced due to stronger interactions with PP chains, as demonstrated by rheological measurements. For PBNANOs the effect of shear on crystallization is more significant due to the higher amount of available surfaces.},

  abstract = {Recent research and initiatives increasingly propose a new approach, based on distributed plastic recycling for open-source (OS) 3D printing technologies, as a way to deal with the issue of plastic waste and to support the development of the circular economy (CE). Distributed recycling can be thought of as a sort of ``smart grid'', composed of small and coordinated recycling units. However, the operational complexity of this distributed approach limits its application. Furthermore, the environmental and economic advantages have yet to be demonstrated. This article therefore explores the economic and environmental feasibility of this distributed plastic recycling approach from a logistics perspective, as a step towards its validation. To achieve this, an optimization mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model was used as an evaluation tool, representing a local closed loop supply chain (CLSC) network. The proposed model is illustrated using a case study of a university seeking to implement a distributed recycling demonstrator in order to recover 3D printing wastes from secondary schools in the northeast of France. Following this step, a sensitivity analysis was carried out considering the market variations (price of virgin plastic filament) and the amount of available plastic waste derived from the schools. The results obtained show positive economic and environmental benefits of carrying out this new method of plastic recycling. This work serves as a basis for continuing to explore the feasibility and replication of the distributed plastic recycling network in other contexts.},

  abstract = {The development and implementation of recycling networks seems to be a promising way to cope with and mitigate the environmental problems of waste. As a mandatory condition, recycling networks must guarantee the achievement of sustainability requirements. Since the first proposal of the TBL (Triple Bottom Line) in the early 1990s, some authors have suggested that this model should be extended to include more dimensions. Recent studies have proposed that for a system to be sustainable, it should not only include the economic, environmental, and social dimensions but must also consider technological and political aspects and their subsequent sustainability indicators for their evaluation. In regard to recycling networks, however, social, technological, and political dimensions are still to be formalized to facilitate their use when designing recycling networks or evaluating their impact. In order to understand how these social, political, and technological dimensions should be integrated into the sustainability evaluation process of a potential recycling network, a systematic literature review has been conducted. A total of 160 journal articles were selected and analyzed. Information was identified on the problem addressed, the recycling domain, the methodologies used, and the social, technological, and political aspects under consideration. A set of social, political, and technological indicators to be considered for the main recycling network problems (design and planning, decision-making and performance evaluation, provider selection, price, and coordination) is then proposed. The main contribution of this work lies in the understanding for future research of how to consider social, political, and technological aspects taking into account the most common problems addressed in a recycling network. At the same time, findings and research gaps have been derived from these results. This study provides a basis for future work oriented toward the holistic evaluation of sustainable recycling networks.},

In this paper, findings are reported from a study that involved development of a new type of 3-D printer. In particular, a novel 3-D printer that is designed specifically for reliable rapid manufacturing at the sites of humanitarian crises. First, required capabilities are developed with design elements of a humanitarian 3-D printer, which include, (1) fused filament fabrication, (2) open source self-replicating rapid prototyper design, (3) modular, (4) separate frame, (5) protected electronics, (6) on-board computing, (7) flexible power supply, and (8) climate control mechanisms. The technology is then disclosed with an open source license for the Kijenzi 3-D Printer. A swarm of five Kijenzi 3-D printers are evaluated for rapid part manufacturing for two months at health facilities and other community locations in both rural and urban areas throughout Kisumu County, Kenya. They were successful for their ability to function independently of infrastructure, transportability, ease of use, ability to withstand harsh environments and costs. The results are presented and conclusions are drawn about future work necessary for the Kijenzi 3-D Printer to meet the needs of rapid manufacturing in a humanitarian context.},

However, additive manufacturing of HDPE by means of fused deposition modeling (FDM) also known as fused filament fabrication (FFF) has been problematic owing to its massive shrinkage, voiding and warpage problems accompanied by its poor adhesion to common build plates and to extruded HDPE strands. Herein we overcome these problems and improve Young's modulus, tensile strength and surface quality of 3D printed HDPE by varying 3D printing parameters like temperature and diameter of the nozzle, extrusion rate, build plate temperature, and build plate material. Both nozzle diameter and printing speed affect surface quality but do not impair mechanical properties. Particularly, an extrusion rate gradient prevents void formation. For the first time additive manufactured HDPE and injection-molded HDPE exhibit similar mechanical properties with exception of elongation at break. Excellent fusion of the extruded polymer strands and the absence of anisotropy are achieved, as verified by microscopic imaging and measuring the tensile strength parallel and perpendicular to the 3D printing direction.},

Transitioning to a circular economy that retains plastic in its highest value condition is essential to reduce environmental impacts, promoting reduction, reuse, and recycling. Mechanical recycling is an essential tool in an environmentally and economically sustainable economy of plastics, but current mechanical recycling processes are limited by cost, degradation of mechanical properties, and inconsistent quality products. This review covers the current methods and challenges for the mechanical recycling of the five main packaging plastics: poly(ethylene terephthalate), polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, and poly(vinyl chloride) through the lens of a circular economy. Their reprocessing induced degradation mechanisms are introduced and strategies to improve their recycling are discussed. Additionally, this review briefly examines approaches to improve polymer blending in mixed plastic waste streams and applications of lower quality recyclate.},

  abstract = {The additive manufacturing (AM) process is used to build three-dimensional (3D)-printed components by depositing layers of materials one over another until it completes the building process. There are numerous ways to improve its strength and rigidity of AM processed components. In this research, we discuss an effective method to improve the strength of 3D-printed component joints by reinforcing carbon fiber (CF) with polylactic acid (PLA) and applying bioinspired interlock sutures. The strength of 3D-printed components is highly influenced by build parameters such as printing speed, extruder temperature, and layer thickness. In this context, the design of experiment (DOE) was made to ensure the effect of build parameters. The specimens were fabricated according to DOE in order to characterize bending behavior, which was analyzed using special fixture. The bending strength and fracture behavior of specimen for three different interlock joints were studied. The analytical technique of particle swarm optimization was adopted to predict the optimum printing parameters to improve the bending strength of the 3D-printed components. The result shows that CF-reinforced PLA with spline interlock suture increases the bending strength of the 3D-printed specimen when compared to pure PLA.},

  abstract = {3D printing has been widely used to rapidly manufacture a variety of solid dosage forms on-demand, without sacrificing precision. This study used extrusion-based 3D printing to prepare single-layered, tri-layered, and core-in-shell poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) films carrying paclitaxel and rapamycin in combination or lidocaine alone. Each layer was composed of either low molecular weight (MW) PLGA or high MW PLGA. In vitro drug release kinetics of paclitaxel, rapamycin, and lidocaine for PLGA films were assessed and compared with PLGA\textendash polyethylene glycol (PEG)\textendash PLGA hydrogel discs. Regardless of the structure of PLGA film, paclitaxel (half-time: 54\textendash 63~days) was released faster than when compared with rapamycin (half-time: 74\textendash 80~days). In contrast, single-layered PLGA\textendash PEG\textendash PLGA discs released rapamycin (half-time 5.7~h) at a more rapid rate than paclitaxel (half-time: 7.3~h). Single-layered PLGA\textendash PEG\textendash PLGA discs enabled a faster drug release than PLGA films, noting that the disc matrices dissolve in water in 24~h. Similarly, lidocaine incorporated in PLGA films (half-time: 13\textendash 36~days) exhibited slower release patterns than that in PLGA\textendash PEG\textendash PLGA discs (half-time: 2.6~h). In vitro drug release patterns were explained using molecular models that simulate drug-polymer interactions. Analysis of models suggested that drug\textendash polymer interactions, location of each drug in the polymeric matrix, and solubility of drugs in water were major factors that determine drug release behaviors from the polymeric films and discs.},

Design/methodology/approach The PLA filaments containing different levels of CaCO3 nanoparticles have been produced by mix-blending/extrusion process and were used to fabricate tensile and three-point bending test samples in FFF process under various sets of printing speed (PS), layer thickness (LT), filling ratio (FR) and printing pattern (PP) under a Taguchi L27 orthogonal array design. The quantified values of mechanical characteristics of 3D-printed samples in the uniaxial and the three-point bending experiments were modeled and optimized using a hybrid neural network/particle swarm optimization algorithm. The results of this hybrid scheme were used to specify the FFF process parameters and the concentration of nanoadditive in the matrix that result in the maximum mechanical properties of fabricated samples, individually and also in an accumulative response scheme. Diffraction scanning calorimetry (DSC) tests were conducted on a number of samples and the results were used to interpret the variations observed in the response variables of fabricated components against the FFF parameters and concentration of CaCO3 nanoadditives. Findings The results of optimization in an accumulative scheme showed that the samples of linear PP, fabricated at high PS, low LT and at 100\% FR, while containing 0.64\% of CaCO3 nanoadditives in the matrix, would possess the highest mechanical characteristics of 3D-printed PLA components. Originality/value FFF is a widely accepted additive manufacturing technique in production of different samples, from prototypes to the final products, in various sectors of industry. The incorporation of chopped fibers and nanoparticles has been introduced recently in a few articles to improve the mechanical characteristics of produced components in FFF technique. However, the effectiveness of such practice is strongly dependent on the extrusion parameters and composition of polymer matrix.},

  abstract = {Since the advent of 3D printing in the mid-1980s, additive manufacturing has grown steadily and found numerous applications across all types of industries. More recently, the industry has seen a spur of growth as the terms of the original patents expired and new companies entered the market. While there exist several different methods of additive manufacturing, polymer-based material extrusion 3D printing (also known as fused filament fabrication) has become one of the most widely used ones due to its lower cost, ease of use, and versatility. While development has greatly expanded the material availability and improved the quality of prints, material extrusion 3D printers have often faced a challenge in physical scaling. There are inherent design hurdles to the extrusion process when the print starts to grow larger. This paper aims to study the market landscape of extrusion-based 3D printing technology for polymer-based material as well as challenges faced in upscaling this technology for industrial applications. A prototype large-scale material extrusion 3D printer has been designed, constructed, and then tested to gain experimental data on large-scale 3D printing using thermoplastic polymers as a printing material. Results of testing and experimentation verified certain key design elements and how they can improve large-scale 3D printing. Testing also revealed how large diameter nozzles for the hot end introduce challenges not seen in small-scale 3D printers. This paper also seeks to consolidate available information pertaining to large-scale 3D printing into one comprehensive document.},

FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) is one type of 3D printing which uses plastics in the form of wire like filament by an extruder for making 3D prints. But, by installing a pellet extruder instead of filament extruder reduces cost of printing process that is 1 kg of PLA pellets cost around 4\texteuro{} while 1 kg of PLA filament cost around 22\texteuro; also, can print wide ranges of materials, increase in speed of prints, chance of recyclability when compared to filament extruder.

Most of the FDM 3D printers use plastics in the form of wire like filament for making 3D prints. This paper provides in detail information about FDM and its types, difference between pellet extruder and filament extruder, their advantages and disadvantages, information about some pellet extruders and type of FDM printers they are suitable for.

  abstract = {One of the most widely used additive manufacturing (AM) methods is Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF), which can produce complex geometry parts. In this process, a continuous filament of thermoplastic material is deposited layer by layer to make the final piece. One of the essential goals in the production of parts with this method is to produce parts with high mechanical properties and excellent geometrical accuracy at the same time. Among the various methods used to improve the desired properties of produced parts is to determine the optimum process parameters in this process. This paper investigates the effect of different process parameters on four essential parameters: chamber temperature, Printing temperature, layer thickness, and print speed on cylindricity, circularity, strength, Young's modulus, and deformation by Gray Relational Analysis method simultaneously. Taguchi method was used to design the experiments, and the PA6 cylindrical parts were fabricated using a German RepRap X500\textregistered{} 3D printer. Then the GRG values were calculated for all experiments. In the 8th trial, the highest value of GRG was observed. Then, to discover the optimal parameters, the GRG data were analyzed using ANOVA and S/N analysis, and it was determined that the best conditions for enhancing GRG are 60 \textdegree C in the chamber temperature, 270 \textdegree C in the printing temperature, 0.1 mm layer thickness, and 600 mm/min print speed. Finally, by using optimal parameters, a verification test was performed, and new components were investigated. Finally, by comparing the initial GRG with the GRG of the experiment, it was discovered that the GRG value had improved by 14\%.},

Accordingly, the effect of each nanoparticle type on this region is precisely evaluated and interpreted. The Janus nanoparticles are synthesized via a two-step desymmetrization process in Pickering emulsion, using different polar/apolar silane agents, while a single-step modification procedure is used to perform the homogenous modification. The designing stages of a comprehensive analytical model are discussed which is used to evaluate the corporation level of the HM and Janus nanoparticles in the recovery mechanism of the BPN samples. The results of different characterizing tests (e.g., tensile, recovery, dynamic mechanical thermal analysis, rheology, etc.) are proposed to demonstrate the impact of different types of nanoparticles on the polymer/polymer interface and shape memory effect (SME) in each sample.

This paper investigates the impact of COVID 19 on the progress of the SDGs and provides insight into how green recovery stimulus, driven by circular economy (CE)-based solid waste management (SWM) could assist in attaining the intended targets of UN-SDG. It was understood in this review that the guiding principles of the UN-SDGs such as, public health, environmental concerns, resource value and economic development are similar to those that have driven the growth of waste management activities; thus, in order to achieve the goals of UN-SDG, a circular economy approach in solid waste management system should be prioritized in the post-COVID economic agenda. However, policy, technology and public involvement issues may hinder the shift to the CE model; therefore, niche growth might come from developing distinctive waste management-driven green jobs, formalizing informal waste pickers and by focusing in education and training of informal worker. The review also emphasized in creating green jobs by investing in recycling infrastructure which would enable us to address the climate change related concerns which is one of the key target of UN- SDG. The CE-based product designs and business models would emphasize multifunctional goods, extending the lifespan of products and their parts, and intelligent manufacturing to help the public and private sectors maximise product utility (thus reducing waste generation) while providing long-term economic and environmental benefits. The study also recommended strong policies that prioritized investments in decentralization of solid waste systems, localization of supply chains, recycling and green recovery, information sharing, and international collaboration in order to achieve the UN-SDGs.},

The emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) during different processes involved in the lifecycle of plastic-related products are a significant threat to the environment as it contributes to global temperature rise. By 2050, a high volume of plastic production will be responsible for up to 13~\% of our planet's total carbon budget. The global emissions of GHG and their persistence in the environment have depleted Earth's residual carbon resources and have generated an alarming feedback loop. Each year at least 8 million tonnes of discarded plastics are entering our oceans, creating concerns regarding plastic toxicity on marine biota as they end up in the food chain and ultimately affect human health. The unsuccessful management of plastic waste and its presence on the riverbanks, coastlines, and landscapes leads to the emission of a higher percentage of GHG in the atmosphere. The persistence of microplastics is also a significant threat to the fragile and extreme ecosystem containing diverse life forms with low genetic variation, making them vulnerable to climatic change. In this review, we have categorically discussed the contribution of plastic and plastic waste to global climate change covering the current plastic production and future trends, the types of plastics and plastic materials used globally, plastic lifecycle and GHG emission, and how microplastics become a major threat to ocean carbon sequestration and marine health. The conjoining impact of plastic pollution and climate change on the environment and human health has also been discussed in detail. In the end, we have also discussed some strategies to reduce the climate impact of plastics.},

  abstract = {Purpose During the 3D printing process, the model needs to add a support structure to ensure structural stability. Excessive support structure reduces printing efficiency and results in material cost. A flexible support platform for 3 D printing has been designed. It can form an external support structure to replace the original support structure. This paper aims to study the influence of a model's build orientation on properties when the model is printed on the platform, aiming to provide users with suitable solutions. Design/methodology/approach A fitness function for estimating the support structure with a support length is constructed. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is modified and applied to find the build orientation that minimizes the support structure. However, when the model is printed on the platform, the build orientation of the minimum support structure enhances the complexity of the working path, resulting in an increase of printing time, which needs to be avoided. This paper applies a multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm to minimize the support structure while minimizing printing time. The Pareto solution is obtained by the algorithm. Findings It is found that the model that has the cantilever structure can reduce more support structure after optimization on the platform, when there is surface quality requirement. When there is no limit, the modified algorithm can minimize the support structure of each model. Considering support structure and printing time, the MOPSO algorithm can easily get optimization results to guide the practical work. Originality/value This paper optimizes the model's build orientation on the flexible support platform by PSO, thereby reducing material cost and improving work efficiency.},

  abstract = {Due to the significant impact on the product quality and performance, the surface roughness of produced parts by 3D printers is one of the important factors in the 3D printing process. Then, the main objective of this research is to determine the optimal composition of input parameters to minimize surface roughness, using hybrid artificial neural network and particle swarm algorithm. For this purpose, after using Central Composite Design (CCD) of experiments with five independent parameters (nozzle temperature, layers thickness, printing speed, nozzle diameter and material density) with three levels, 43 flat parts were produced with a three-dimensional printer, and roughness tests were performed on produced parts. After training experimental matrix by multilayer perceptron neural network (7-4-1) with a coefficient of 0.95, the subjected matrix was combined with the particle swarm algorithm to determine the optimal composition of input parameters. To verify results accuracy, the optimized process parameters obtained from the combined algorithm, have been tested with experimental results. In addition, to specify the effect of input parameters on the surface roughness, a quadratic model has been developed using Response Surface Method (RSM). Based on results of the hybrid algorithm, the optimal combination of input parameters was extracted. It was inferred that, the nozzle temperature of 192.20~\textdegree C, the layers' thickness of 100~{$\mu$}m, the printing speed of 97.06~mm/s, the nozzle diameter of 0.3~mm and the internal density of 24.88\% lead to the surface roughness of 11.319. Therefore, the use of this hybrid algorithm improves the surface quality of the printed parts during the 3D printing process.},

The surface morphology of PP/PET/PP-g-AA blends was studied by means of SEM. The compatibilization of PP/PET blends was improved and the size of PET island components decreased remarkably, which can be demonstrated from that the compatibilized blends could easily be spun into fibres. The composite fibres were prepared and the morphology, thermal and mechanical properties of composite fibres were investigated. It was found that micro-fibres grow from PET island components, and the mechanical properties of the composite fibres could be potentially improved due to the enhancement of interface bonding efficiency, i.e. increase of friction between a fibre where the micro-fibres were grown and surrounded by materials. In the DSC examination, it was observed that PET could serve as heterogeneous nucleation agent which could benefit the crystallization of PP.},

This process is commercially acceptable for producing parts with different materials (thermoplastic, wax, etc.), which can be formed into desired shape and can be used as consumable pattern in investment casting (IC) process. The IC process has been established for production of difficult to made parts with high accuracy and finish. By combining both these novel processes, the researchers are serving the field of medicine to satisfy the needs of society. The vapour smoothing is one of the recently developed surface finishing techniques, which has potential to draw remarkable results to improve the quality of FDM replicas and support the IC process to enhance the properties of casted parts. So, in this paper an attempt has been made to develop a biomedical implant by combining these three processes.

In the present study, an attempt was made to investigate the Melt Flow Index (MFI), tensile strength, and electrical and thermal conductivity of nylon 6 and ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) thermoplastics reinforced with copper particles. Thus, the experiments were conducted by adding different-sized copper particles (100 mesh, 200 mesh, and 400 mesh) in variable compositions (0\% to 10\%) to ABS and nylon 6 matrix. The impact of single, double, and triple particle-sized copper particles on MFI was experimentally investigated followed by FTIR and SEM analysis. Also, the tensile, electrical, and thermal conductivity testing were done on filament made by different compositions. In general, higher fluidity and mechanical strength were obtained while using smaller particles even with higher concentrations (up to 8\%) due to improved bonding strength and adhesion between the molecular chains. Moreover, thermal and electrical conductivity was improved with an increase in concentration of copper particles.},

This environmental problem results from human industrial and domestic activities, associated with poor management, from manufacturing processes to products' end life.

Thus, understanding public perceptions about plastic pollution may be a valuable resource to engage society in solutions to reduce its environmental release. In this study, perceptions about plastic pollution, its impacts as well as sociodemographic and psychological factors predicting individuals' pro-environmental behaviours were analysed, in the Portuguese context. Overall, results showed that there is a general knowledge that plastics degrade in the environment. The participants of the study perceived the bio-ecological impacts of plastics as a greater threat than the socioeconomic impacts. A hierarchical regression analyses revealed that sociodemographic variables and those related to knowledge and perceived impacts about plastic pollution can predict participants' pro-environmental behaviours. Awareness about the impacts of plastic pollution (socioeconomic, health impacts and bio-ecological impacts) were highly associated to pro-environmental behaviour. This study data can help to understand how to enhance pro-environmental behaviours and contribute to decrease the presence of micro(nano)plastics in the environment.},

Further, implications in employing classical laminate mechanics for characterizing the mechanical behavior of printed parts are discussed in detail. Mechanical testing on printed test coupons revealed that build orientation significantly influenced the final properties, with properties being especially poor in parts built with upright orientation. Further, the overall performance of parts made of composite material is lower than that of polymeric parts. Finally, mechanical performance of 3D printed functional part was assessed to demonstrate the influence of printing strategy on its final material behavior under actual loading scenario. It was revealed that the mechanical performance of the printed functional part was substantially influenced by its build orientation and material composition.

This study investigates the mechanical properties of 3D printed parts using a commercial open-source 3D printer for a wide range of materials. The samples are tested for tensile strength following ASTM D638. The results are presented and conclusions are drawn about the mechanical properties of various fused filament fabrication materials. The study demonstrates that the tensile strength of a 3D printed specimen depends largely on the mass of the specimen, for all materials. Thus, to solve the challenge of unknown print quality on mechanical properties of a 3D printed part a two step process is proposed, which has a reasonably high expectation that a part will have tensile strengths described in this study for a given material. First, the exterior of the print is inspected visually for sub-optimal layers. Then, to determine if there has been under-extrusion in the interior, the mass of the sample is measured. This mass is compared to the theoretical value using densities for the material and the volume of the object. This two step process provides a means to assist low-cost open-source 3D printers expand the range of object production to functional parts.},

The non-isothermal crystallization and melting behavior, and the crystallization morphology were investigated by DSC and POM. The chemical reactions of r-PET with PP-g-MA and PP-g-GMA were characterized by FT-IR. DSC results show that the crystallization peak temperatures (Tcp) of r-PET and PP increased when blending them together, due to the heterogeneous nucleation effect on each other. The Tcp of r-PET increased with increasing the content of PP-g-MA while slightly influenced by the content of PP-g-GMA in the binary blends of r-PET with grafted PP, implying different reactivity of r-PET with PP-g-MA and PP-g-GMA. The Tcp of PP in the ternary blends retained or slightly decreased, dependent on the compatibilizers and their contents. The melting peak temperature (Tmp) of r-PET in PP/r-PET blends compatibilized by PP-g-MA was lower than that of compatibilized by PP-g-GMA, indicating that PP-g-MA had stronger reactivity towards r-PET compared to PP-g-GMA. The crystallization and melting behavior of blends was influenced by the pre-melting temperature, especially the melting behavior of r-PET in the blends. The crystallization behavior of PP in the blends was also evaluated by Mo's method. POM confirmed the heterogeneous nucleation effect of r-PET on PP.},

  abstract = {{$\beta$}-Nucleated polypropylene (PP), non-compatibilized and compatibilized {$\beta$}-nucleated PP/recycled poly(ethylene terephthalate) (r-PET) blends were prepared on a twin-screw extruder.

Effects of r-PET content, compatibilizer type and content, pre-melting temperature and time on the non-isothermal crystallization and melting behavior, and polymorphism of PP in the blends were investigated by differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). DSC results show that the crystallization temperature of PP crystallized predominantly in {$\beta$}-modification was higher than that of neat PP. In the non-compatibilized blend, PP matrix crystallized mainly in {$\alpha$}-modification even if r-PET content was only 10wt\%. However, PP-g-MA compatibilization made PP matrix crystallize mainly in {$\beta$}-modification, but PP-g-GMA, POE-g-MA and EVA-g-MA did not improve the {$\beta$}-modification content distinctly. The {$\alpha$}-crystal melting peak temperature of PP decreased with increasing pre-melting temperature, but r-PET content, compatibilizer type and content as well as pre-melting time had no obvious effect on the melting temperature of PP. The increase in PP-g-MA content, pre-melting temperature and time was benefit for the formation of {$\beta$}-modification. It is suggested that the {$\beta$}-nucleating agent is encapsulated or dissolved in polar r-PET in {$\beta$}-nucleated PP/r-PET blend, addition of PP-g-MA to the non-compatibilized blend resulted in transferring {$\beta$}-nucleating agent from r-PET phase into PP phase, the increase in PP-g-MA content, melting temperature and time was benefit for transferring {$\beta$}-nucleating agent from r-PET phase into PP phase.

To make a homogeneous blend, maleic anhydride functionalized PP (PP-g-MAH) was used as a compatibilizer in 60\% PET blends. In all blends, PET's percentage crystallinity was reduced as compared to pure PET because there were hindrances in chains packing because of the presence of PP chains. The addition of compatibilizer in PET and PP blend enhanced interactions resulted in a homogeneous blend with fewer voids. 2.5\% of PP-g-MAH was observed to be the optimum value of compatibilizer in the blend of PET and PP. The decrease in free space inside the blend hindered water molecules' passage through the sheets. Owing to this, water vapor permeability of the blend was less compared to pure PET. The addition of the nonpolar PP also influenced the water transmittance rate of blended sheets.},

At a high percentage of grafting, lower molecular weight product was produced, which was analyzed by viscosity change during and after the reaction. Percentage crystallinity increased by grafting due to the shorter chains, which consequently led to an improvement in the chain's packing.

The most common form of this technology is material extrusion (ME) in which material is deposited layer-by-layer to produce a highly customized part. However, this additive production method has experienced difficulty in widespread adoption in metal fabrication due to the inability to produce metallic parts with strong mechanical properties. This study presents some innovations on a new metal-fabrication technique for ME printing that allows for low-cost metal printing. A metal powder polymer composite filament, with a high metal composition, can be printed and sintered to yield a part that is completely metal. Overall, this study provides the initial investigation of the microstructural behavior and the resulting hardness levels. This study found that the metal powder in finished parts is fused by approximately 90\% derived from the percent area porosity on a microstructural level. The final hardness of the processed parts is reduced by approximately 60\%. Characterizing these properties is the initial step in incorporating ME technology in the field of metal 3D printing.},

  abstract = {Cranial vault defects may be acquired or congenital in origin. Rehabilitation of these patients often poses challenge to the operating team and prosthodontist. Polymethylmethacrylate is a commonly used alloplastic graft material which is used for the fabrication of cranial prosthesis. Nowadays, with the advancement in the bioengineering, custom-made template and cranial prosthesis can be made by rapid prototyping technology (RPT) by patient three-dimensional (3D) computed tomography (CT) scan images. This series of two cases explained two different techniques for the rehabilitation of the patient with frontotemporoparietal cranial defect. Case 1 had a history of cerebrovascular accident, followed by decompression craniotomy which led to frontotemporoparietal defect of the left side. This defect area was associated with the cerebrospinal fluid accumulation which made delineation of underlying bony margins difficult and interfered with conventional impression procedures. Case 2 had a road traffic accident which led to intracerebral hemorrhage followed by decompression craniotomy which resulted in frontotemporoparietal defect of the right side. The patient had a poor neuromuscular control which impedes with the upright posture of the head during impression making of the defect area. Therefore, these cases were planned to rehabilitate by RPT. In these techniques, the prosthesis was made using custom-made skull template produced by RPT, using the data of 3D-CT scan images. This technique resulted in the prosthesis with good esthetics and better fit of the prosthesis. The contours of the prosthesis were replicated in the same manner as compared to the contralateral side. RPT is an additive manufacturing technology which is now used in the field of dentistry too. This technique is easy to use; fabricate prosthesis with high precision is less time-consuming and has fewer chances of error.},

The rPE with the highest impact resistance was made from the single-grade bottle bodies. The addition of bodies made from other types of PE already reduced the impact resistance with 11\%. All the other stepwise additions of packaging components and faultily sorted objects caused the impact resistance to decrease further. Conversely, the elongation at break grew with the stepwise addition of these packaging components and faultily sorted objects. From the used methods, the best analysis method to accurately determine the polymeric composition of the rPE was found to be near-infrared-assisted flake analysis. This method can not only be used to determine the polymeric composition, but due to the strong correlation with the impact resistance, it is also a valuable indicator for the expected mechanical properties of rPE.},

Meanwhile, the flammability of the materials was also determined through the limiting oxygen index (LOI) method. It was found that blends with higher RPP content or contain CaCO3 exhibited higher resistance to thermal degradation judging from their higher activation energies.

  abstract = {Vulvovaginal candidiasis is a vaginal infection caused by the fungal pathogen Candida albicans that, most commonly, affects women of reproductive age. Its first-line treatment consists in topical applications of conventional drug formulations (e.g., creams, gels, tablets) containing imidazole drugs. The treatment involves single or multiple daily applications and, in the case of recurrences, daily administration of oral antifungal drugs for up to one month. Intravaginal rings are flexible, biocompatible medical devices that, compared to conventional drug formulations, offer the possibility of a controlled vaginal drug delivery over a determined period with a single application, thus increasing patient compliance. Among innovative manufacturing techniques, in recent years, fused deposition modeling 3D printing has emerged in the pharmaceutical field to produce different therapeutics combining drugs and polymers. This technique allows to print objects layer by layer with many different thermoplastic materials after a computer-assisted design. Thermoplastic polyurethanes are flexible and biocompatible materials that can be efficiently employed for the manufacturing of drug release systems, already utilized to prepare vaginal devices. In this work, we produced a clotrimazole-loaded intravaginal ring by fused deposition modeling 3D printing combining the drug with thermoplastic polyurethane using hot melt extrusion. The rings were computer-designed and then printed with two different drug concentrations (i.e., 2\% and 10\% w/w). The intravaginal rings were first tested in an agar-diffusion test to evaluate their effectiveness against C. albicans; and the 10\% loaded ring was selected for further studies. Drug release was evaluated in two different media (i.e., 50\% ethanol and vaginal fluid simulant) showing a sustained release over a period of seven days. Next, in vitro time-kill analysis against C. albicans in simulated vaginal fluid was performed and displayed a complete growth inhibition after 5~days, compared to the control. These results suggest a potential application of these 3D printed intravaginal rings for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis and for the long-time treatment of recurrences.},

A tert-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc)-protected polyethylene precursor was thermolytically deprotected during the melt-blending process to render the reactive amine termini. Spectroscopic analysis of a model reaction confirmed the presence of amide functionality in the resultant material. Through blending studies, we found that low loadings of ATPE (0.5 wt \%) significantly reduced the volume of the dispersed HDPE phase particles by a factor of 8 when compared to a binary PET/HDPE blend as assessed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Mechanical analysis of the ATPE-compatibilized blends showed a 12-fold increase in the elongation at break over the unmodified PET/HDPE blend. Ultimately, the results here offer a new approach to reactively compatibilize and toughen PET/HDPE blends and open the door for other uses of amino-telechelic polyethylene.}

  abstract = {Several small molecules can be cocrystallized with polymers to form inclusion compounds (ICs). Urea, perhydrotriphenylene and the cyclodextrins are examples, and serve to form the host crystalline lattice containing the guest polymer chains in their ICs. The guest polymer chains are confined to narrow, cylindrical channels created by the host, small-molecule lattice, where the polymers are highly extended as a consequence of being squeezed, and are separated from neighbouring polymer chains by the IC channel walls composed exclusively of the small-molecule lattice. The net result is a unique solid-state environment for polymers residing in IC channels, which can be utilized as model systems for ordered, bulk polymer phases. Comparison of the behaviour of polymer chains isolated and extended in IC crystals with the behaviour observed for ordered, bulk phases of polymers is beginning to permit an assessment of contributions made by the inherent, single chain and the cooperative, interchain interactions to the properties of ordered, bulk polymers. It is also possible to release and coalesce polymers from their IC crystals in a manner which leads to their consolidation with a chain-extended morphology. Embedding polymer IC crystals into a carrier polymer, followed by in situ release and coalescence of the included polymers from their IC crystals, offers a means to obtain polymer-polymer composites with unique morphologies. Several such polymer IC-generated composites are described and it is suggested that their unique morphologies might translate into useful, tailorable properties, as well as providing a means for addressing several questions that are fundamental to the behaviour of both phase-separated and homogeneous polymer solids.},

  abstract = {Anisotropic mechanical properties related to build orientation is a characteristic of parts fabricated with 3D printing technologies. In the development of new materials for 3D printing processes, understanding the effects of 3D printer build orientation and raster pattern on physical property and failure mode differences is extremely important. While there is currently no standard for the evaluation of build orientation-based mechanical performance, such analysis has typically been achieved through the fabrication and scrutiny of tensile and other test coupons which were printed in different build orientations. In some cases, printing specimens in the ZXY (or vertical) build orientation can be difficult due to the capability of a given 3D printer platform. There are also multiple tensile test specimen geometries specified in the ASTM D638 standard for the tensile testing of polymer materials and understanding which specimen geometry works best for 3D printing is not currently well understood. The work presented here explores the effect of tensile test specimen geometry on the anisotropy of mechanical properties related to the build orientation of tensile test specimens. The test coupons were fabricated using a material extrusion 3D printing platform based on fused deposition modeling technology using a grade of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene not typically used in 3D printing in order to simulate the testing of a new material. The effects of raster pattern and the geometric dependence of mechanical property anisotropy were explored, and validation of the use of ``faux vertical'' specimens in lieu of ZXY-printed specimens was demonstrated. Finally, scanning electron microscopy was used to perform fractography on the various versions of the printed tensile test specimens in order to determine the effect of raster pattern on failure mode.},

We studied two types of scraps of recycled PET: one arising from homogeneous deposits of bottles and the other of heterogeneous deposits soiled by contaminants such as PVC and adhesives. The presence of contaminants and residual moisture coming in the shape of scraps facilitate the crystallization of recycled PET compared to virgin PET and induces cleavages of chains during the melt processing. This leads to a reduction in intrinsic viscosity and consequently in molecular weight, and these decreases are more significant when the recycled resin is soiled. Virgin PET exhibited a ductile behavior ({$>$}200\% of elongation at break),whereas post-consumer PET bottles exhibited a brittle one ({$<$}10\% of elongation at break). This is a consequence of the difference in crystallinity, the presence of impurities in the recycled PET and the different thermal and mechanical history of the virgin and recycled materials.},

In this paper, a screw extrusion method was developed to overcome the existing problems of the filament-feeding method. Excellent flow stability (b 3\% variation) and high printing speed (up to 370 mm/s) for PEEK printing were achieved. Highly reproducible mechanical tests of the printing products were demonstrated with 96\% of the bulk material strength for the first time. Furthermore, an exchangeable printing head was built to cover both line- and plane-printing needs to widen its applications and improve printing surface quality (up to 0.945 nm in Ra). All printed material had a more brittle character in comparison with the bulk material and the post annealing process was found to have no significant effect on the mechanical strength. Additionally, porous artificial intervertebral cages with controllable size and distribution were manufactured to demonstrate potential applications.},

The effect of selected process parameters (including nozzle temperature, layer height, raster orientation and deposition speed) as well as their combinative effects are also studied. Specifically, in the first step, a Taguchi orthogonal array was employed to design the Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) experiments with a minimal number of runs, while considering different working conditions (temperatures) of the final prints. The significance of process parameters was measured using Lenth's statistical method. Combinative effects of FDM parameters were noted to be highly nonlinear and complex. Next, artificial neural networks were trained to predict both the storage and loss moduli of the 3D printed samples, and consequently, the process parameters were optimized via Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The optimized process of the prints showed overall a closer behavior to that of the parent (unprocessed) ABS, when compared to the unoptimized set-up.},

  abstract = {Fused filament fabrication (FFF) is the most popular additive manufacturing method, which allows the production of highly complex three-dimensional parts with minimal material waste. On the other hand, polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG) has been used to replace traditional polymers for 3D printing due to its chemical resistance and mechanical performance, among other benefits. However, when fibres are added, these PETG-based composites can be suitable for many different applications. Nevertheless, to guarantee their good performance in-service in these applications, and even extend to new ones, it is necessary for their mechanical properties to be maximized. Therefore, this study intends to optimize the printing parameters (nozzle temperature, printing speed, layer height and filling) in order to maximize the mechanical properties of printed PETG, PETG+CF (carbon fibre-reinforced PETG composites) and PETG+KF (aramid fibre-reinforced PETG composites). The Taguchi method was used for the experimental procedure design, and the specimens were produced according to the L16 orthogonal array. Finally, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed, with a 95\% confidence interval, to analyse the effect of the printing parameters on the bending properties. It was possible to conclude that the best bending properties for PETG, PETG+CF and PETG+KF were obtained for extrusion temperatures of 265 \textdegree C, 195 \textdegree C and 265 \textdegree C, printing speeds of 20, 60 and 20 mm/s, layer heights of 0.4, 0.53 and 0.35 mm and an infill density of 100\% for the three materials, respectively.},

  abstract = {The production of plastic has grown exponentially over the past few decades and with it the amount of plastic waste leaking in the environment, where it fragments into micro- and nanoplastics. This problematic situation stresses the need for increased plastic collection, recycling and reuse rates. Extrusion-based additive manufacturing (AM) and especially fused filament fabrication (FFF) offer an efficient and effective method to reuse and upcycle recycled plastic. This study focuses on poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), which has a broad application window and its recycling is therefore environmentally and economically favorable and sustainable. Therefore, this study involves the thermal and mechanical behavior of recycled PET after extrusion and 3D printing. The extrusion parameters are optimized by performing a complete physico-chemical and thermal analysis of the obtained filaments and they were compared with commercial virgin and recycled PET.

  abstract = {The production of plastic has grown exponentially over the past few decades and with it the amount of plastic waste leaking in the environment, where it fragments into micro- and nanoplastics. This problematic situation stresses the need for increased plastic collection, recycling and reuse rates. Extrusion-based additive manufacturing (AM) and especially fused filament fabrication (FFF) offer an efficient and effective method to reuse and upcycle recycled plastic. This study focuses on poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), which has a broad application window and its recycling is therefore environmentally and economically favorable and sustainable. Therefore, this study involves the thermal and mechanical behavior of recycled PET after extrusion and 3D printing. The extrusion parameters are optimized by performing a complete physico-chemical and thermal analysis of the obtained filaments and they were compared with commercial virgin and recycled PET. Moreover, the influence of the applied processing conditions on the degree of crystallinity and mechanical properties is investigated. The filaments are then used for FFF, where various printing parameters are altered to obtain the optimum printing conditions (i.e. printing temperature, the build plate temperature, fan cooling and printing directions). The effect of the degree of crystallinity of semi-crystalline PET is investigated via altered printing parameters, showing superior mechanical properties for an increasing degree of crystallinity.

A fourth set was made with the addition of a compatibiliser block copolymer poly(styrene-co-(ethylene-butylene)- styrene) grafted with maleic anhydride (SEBSgMAH) in order to evaluate the (lack of) progressive degradation effects and the morphology stabilisation of adding the compatibiliser. After the third reprocessing cycle Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) showed a severe destabilisation of the PP-PET blends while there was only minor destabilisation observed for the compatibilized mix. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) highlighted an increase in PET's crystallinity enthalpy for every set. This increase was less prominent for the compatibilised blend because fractionated crystallisation occurred. Fourier Transformed Infrared (FTIR) and rotational rheology confirmed that the degradation was less severe for the compatibilised blend. The demixing and degradation resulted in changed mechanical properties shown by a decreased strain at break and strain at yield. This decrease was more pronounced in the uncompatibilised blend than in the compatibilised blend over the five extrusions, thus confirming the stabilisation of the ternary blend.},

The degradation and retained functionality of these compatibilizers was assessed by means of simultaneous thermo-gravimetric analysis, melt flow index, a morphology study, differential scanning calorimetry and tensile testing. The results show that degradation of the compatibilized blends during multiple processing is low, although the core stability of the blends depends on the initial stability of all of the components in the blend. The thermal stability across the five extrusions was the most favorable for the matrix based grafted compatibilized blend.

The enhanced interactions between the phases are assessed via critical plastic strain (onset of fine slip caused by local intra-/interlamellar slip) and critical elastic strain (onset of fibrillation of crystalline skeleton). Polypropylene-poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PP-PET) blends were compatibilized with three maleic anhydride grafted compatibilizers with different backbones: PP, SEBS, and POE. Using this critical onset strain method, via free shrinkage experiments, allowed to identify the effect of PET on the matrix's deformation and also the different contributions of the compatibilizers to the deformation mechanisms. Results showed that PPgMAH promoted best PET's plastic deformation to the matrix, relative to the other compatibilizers. However, SEBSgMAH's elastomeric backbone provide better stress dissipation before onset of fibrillation compared to the binary blend and matrix. This method can be used as a way to assess the effectiveness of a compatibilizer in an immiscible blend.},

Traumatic upper limb injuries are among the most common conditions worldwide. In the case of a traumatic bone fractures it is crucial to provide immobilisation of the affected limb in the correct anatomical position to achieve the desirable healing process. Thus, splints and casts play an essential role in the healing and rehabilitation progress. 3D printing is a powerful tool in creating personalized biomedical devices, therefore, medical aids for the treatment of bone fractures are amongst the most promising fields of medical 3D printing. In medical care, the most extensively used area of additive manufacturing is Fused-Filament-Fabrication (FFF). In our study we have investigated two different unique PLA-CaCO3 composites. To access the characteristics of the composites, dynamic and static mechanical stability tests were performed along with scanning electron microscopy for the structural analysis, and also manufactured splints with the help of 3D design and thermoforming methods. According to our results the new materials are potentially viable in clinical environment, but further laboratory and clinical investigations are necessary. Our aim is to continue the feasibility tests and establish the appropriate clinical trials.},

Recycled PET filaments were thus produced by extrusion from collected PET bottles, with the potential addition of HDPE, which comes from caps and rings. The microstructure, mechanical performance, and printing quality of parts produced with these filaments were investigated in comparison to commercial PET virgin and recycled filaments. HDPE presence as an immiscible blend did not affect the ease of extrusion or the quality of the printing, which were all satisfactory. In some conditions, the addition of 5 wt\% of HDPE to recycled PET had a toughening effect on otherwise brittle samples. This behavior was attributed to the presence of elongated HDPE inclusions resulting from shear forces induced by the layer-by-layer printing, provided that the interface temperature remained high between layer depositions. This confirms that the mechanical performance of recycled PET is very sensitive to the processing conditions, especially in the case of 3D printing. Nonetheless, this low-cost process that did not require sophisticated compatibilization schemes allowed for the printing of parts with mechanical properties comparable to those obtained with high purity, commercially recycled filaments, opening interesting perspectives for a low-cost PET recycling process.},

Homologous series of hybrids were also synthesized employing blends of PP/PET and compared with those of the pure PP to investigate possible beneficial effects due to the presence of small amounts of PET on the microstructure and properties of this kind of materials. The analysis of the results indicates some extension of both macromolecules intercalation and clay particles exfoliation in the hybrids prepared with the organophilic montmorillonite.

In this study Poly Lactic Acid (PLA) was used as the base polymer which was reinforced with Halloysite Nanotubes (HNT) powder as they are known to be biodegradable and has high mechanical properties individually. HNT loadings with 3\% and 5\% were added to PLA by the method of twin screw extrusion and pelletized. For comparison, the PLA on its own was also extruded and pelletized. The resultant homogeneous pellets was extruded successfully into filaments of 1.75{$\pm$}0.10 mm diameter using twin screw extruder with specialized die fixed to the extruder for the manufacture of production grade 3D printing filament. This resultant filament was utilized for Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) into standard tensile test bars and 25mm medical implants using a standard FFF printing machine. The 3D printed samples were characterized for mechanical properties by uniaxial tensile test and thermal stability by Differential scanning calorimetry. Interestingly there was no significant change in the mechanical properties of the 3D printed tensile bars due to the processing parameters during FFF. However, the decrease in cold crystallization temperature by DSC indicates the nucleating effect of the HNT on the PLA matrix which in turn increases the mechanical properties. We could successfully 3D print model medical implants.},

Compared to conventional molding techniques, fused deposition modeling (FDM)-based 3D printing is a smart manufacturing technology for thermoplastics due to its low cost, ease of production of complex geometrical parts, rapid prototyping, and scalable customization. FDM 3D printing can be an ideal manufacturing technology for polyolefins to manufacture various complex parts. However, FDM 3D-printing of polyolefins is challenged bycritical printing problems like high warpage, dimensional inaccuracies, poor bed adhesion, and poor layer-to-layer adhesion. In this review, a fundamental understanding of polyolefins and their FDM 3D-printing process is established, and the recent progress of FDM 3D printing of polyolefins is summarized. Furthermore, strategies to overcome warpage and to improve mechanical strength of the 3D-printed polyolefins are provided. Finally, future prospectives of FDM 3D-printing of polyolefins are critically discussed to inspire prospective research in this field. It is believed that this review article can be tremendously useful for research work related to FDM of polyolefin-based materials.},

According to the elemental analysis of charcoal, there were no significant amounts of sulphur, but silicon and potassium oxides were predominantly composed followed by aluminium, titanium, magnesium and iron according to the analysis of ashes. The addition of thermoplastic binders allowed producing pellets and it was found that those produced by using HDPE are stronger than those produced with PET.},

However, the use of this type of feedstock increases costs and narrows the variety of materials that can be used. The development of technologies that allow polymer pellets to be processed as feedstock would increase the popularity of polymer extrusion by addressing these two issues. This work describes the development of a piston-driven extrusion head that can extrude polypropylene granules into a filament. The head was designed to minimize the volume of material fused during the extrusion process and reduce the effect of material degradation. Experiments were conducted to characterize the dimensions of the filaments generated. Material degradation inside the extrusion head was assessed by infrared spectroscopy, and its effect on filament strength was analyzed by tensile tests. The results showed that the system was able to produce a continuous filament. Spectroscopy revealed that degradation occurs inside the heated cylinder but does not greatly influence the strength of the extrudate. However, a flow variation along the length of the filament was observed. For the proposed system to be considered feasible for AM, this variation needs to be better understood and controlled.},

Given that a large number of different 3D printers (AM machines) are present now (as a product of renowned manufacturers or custom-made products), the design of a benchmark artifact for evaluation of the AM processes is very important. This implies quality evaluation of the capabilities and limitations of each AM process and also the geometrical testing of the 3D printers. The paper proposes a benchmark artifact, according to the criteria for modeling of the benchmark artifact, with a large number of basic features for its geometrical evaluation. Although there are a large number of commercial software packages, this paper also proposes a low-cost developed measurement method of geometrical deviation that could be also adjustable for requirements in an easy way. Verification of the proposed deviation measurement method has been done by several experiments. The experiments include fabrication of the proposed benchmark artifact on available 3D printers by an FFF (fused filament fabrication) process also known as FDM (fused deposition modeling), and after that its scanning. Verification is done by comparing quality evaluation of each fabricated part by developed method and commercial software.},

  abstract = {Purpose \textendash{} Congenital telipes equinovarus (CTEV) or club foot is a historical foot deformity where the foot is turned in and pointing down causing the subject to walk on the outside edges of foot. The non-surgical correction of this deformity is an unsolved challenging problem in the medical domain and it becomes interesting due to the increasing number of such patients. The purpose of this paper is to build a biomodel of this historical foot deformity in newborn babies and hence an attempt to develop a corrective procedure using rapid prototyping (RP). Design/methodology/approach \textendash{} Biomodeling is a new technology that allows medical scan data sets to generate solid plastic replicas of anatomical structures. The medical scan data sets of live club foot baby patients were acquired and after image processing, biomodels of four live unilateral club foot baby patients are developed in a fused deposition modeling RP system. Findings \textendash{} The paper shows the location and position of abnormal bones and abnormal tarsal joints and is useful for management of club foot deformity in newborn babies. On visual study, it is observed that the talus is underdeveloped, talar neck is shorter and deviated in the medial and planter direction. Research limitations/implications \textendash{} The major outcome of this paper is the detailed geometrical visualization of talus bone of club foot and normal foot that assists in diagnosis and better treatment of CTEV. In future, the developed biomodels of club foot help to develop a corrective device that assists in bringing the club to normal foot geometrys. Practical implications \textendash{} These developed biomodels of club foot help in deciding the best corrective procedure for surgeons. The geometrical comparison between normal and club foot helps in developing a non-surgical corrective procedure of this historical foot deformity. A 3D representation of talus bone provides an opportunity to view talus and analyse the ankle joint geometry that develops a favorable condition for diagnosis and treatment of this deformity. Originality/value \textendash{} The first time developed biomodels of clubfeet helps orthopaedic surgeons in preoperative surgical planning and consequently in carrying out biomechanical studies of club foot. The presented research plays a major role in planning a non-surgical corrective procedure of this historical deformity. It also provides a platform for finite element analysis of club foot.},

Therefore, librarians at the Touro College School of Health Sciences began exploring 3D printing for inclusion in the occupational and physical therapy curriculum. Case Presentation: The goal of this project was to educate occupational and physical therapy students and faculty about the potential applications of 3D printing in health care and provide hands-on experience, while increasing collaboration between librarians and faculty. Students' tasks included designing and creating a 3D-printed assistive device as part of their course. Conclusion: Students were able to successfully print assistive devices, demonstrating the feasibility of 3D printing in a health sciences curriculum. Librarians involved with this project reached approximately 78 students and 200 other librarians and faculty members. 3D printing at Touro College continues to evolve and expand; the trial 3D printing course is being reviewed for formal adoption into the occupational therapy curriculum, and additional funding for 3D printing technologies is currently being allocated by Touro administration.},

The {$\beta$}-nucleated iPP/compatibilizers blends, {$\beta$}-nucleated iPP/PET blends and its compatibilized versions with four kinds of compatibilizers (PP-g-MA, PP-g-GMA, POE-g-MA, and EVA-g-MA) were prepared by different blending ways. The effect of compatibilizers and blending ways on the non-isothermal crystallization and melting characteristics and the {$\beta$}-crystallization tendency of {$\beta$}-nucleated iPP blends were studied by differential scanning calorimetry. The relative content of the {$\beta$}-phase were characterised by the k{$\beta$}values determined on the basis of the wide angle X-ray diffractogram. The results indicated that the {$\beta$}-crystallization tendency of {$\beta$}-nucleated iPP blends depends on the kinds of compatibilizer. Addition of PP-g-MA significantly reduced the {$\beta$}-crystallization tendency of {$\beta$}-nucleated iPP, while PP-g-GMA, POE-g-MA, and EVA-g-MA have little effect on it. In the compatibilized {$\beta$}-nucleated iPP/PET blends, the blending ways, which controlled the dispersion of {$\beta$}-nucleating agent, influences the {$\beta$}-crystallization tendency intensively. The high {$\beta$}-crystallization tendency and {$\beta$}-crystal content were obtained for compatibilized {$\beta$}-nucleated iPP/PET blends prepared firstly at high temperature and {$\beta$}-nucleating agent added into blends at low temperature; however, the type of compatibilizers has little effect on {$\beta$}-crystallization tendency and melting behavior of blends.},

In particular, blending with poly(hydroxyl butyrate) (PHB; 20 m\%) allows to control both MFI and crystallinity without the need for annealing.},

  abstract = {Large Area Additive Manufacturing (LAAM) polymer deposition employs a single screw extruder to deliver pelletized feedstock resulting in significantly higher flow rates as compared to conventional filament-based extrusion additive processes. Swirling kinematics in LAAM melt flow that result from the screw rotation generate unique particle alignment patterns within the fiber-filled polymer during deposition processing. This paper investigates the effect of the single screw swirling motion on the resulting fiber orientation in a short fiber polymer composite extrudate. An axisymmetric non-Newtonian viscoelastic flow is simulated with the finite element method, where the flow nearby the extruder screw tip, within the printing nozzle, and a short section of free extrudate compose the flow domain. Fiber orientation tensors within the flow domain are evaluated using the Wang-O'Gara-Tucker Reduced Strain Closure (RSC) fiber orientation diffusion model with the orthotropic fitted closure. The results indicate that swirling kinematics yield a longer flow path for fibers to travel and orientate within the flow domain, yielding orientation tensor results that are notably different as compared to a non-swirl event. The predicted principal elastic constant from the swirling flow and non-swirling flow models exhibit 21\% difference, and those from the swirling model using the RSC closure shows a good agreement with reported experimental data for a similar material system.},

Caffeine citrate was used as the model drug for its bitter taste, and a 3-point bend test was performed to assess the printability of filaments. The stiffness constant was calculated to represent the printability by fitting the breaking distances and stress data into Hooke's law. The formulations without Eudragit E PO (F6) and with Eudragit E PO (F7) filaments exhibited the desired hardness with a ``k'' value of 48.30\,{$\pm$}\,3.52 and 45.47\,{$\pm$}\,3.51~g/mm3 (n~=\,10), respectively, and were successfully printed. The donut-shaped tablets were 3D printed with 10, 50, and 100\% infill densities. In vitro dissolution studies were performed in simulated salivary fluid (pH 6.8, artificial saliva) to evaluate the taste-masking efficiency of the printed donuts. In the first minute, the concentrations of caffeine citrate observed in the dissolution media from all the printed donuts were less than the bitter threshold of caffeine citrate (0.25~mg/mL). Formulation F7, which contained Eudragit E PO copolymer, demonstrated better taste-masking efficiency than formulation F6. Furthermore, both formulations F6 and F7 demonstrated immediate drug release profiles in gastric medium (10\% infill, {$>$}\,80\% release within 1~h). Taste-masked caffeine citrate formulations were successfully developed with donut shapes, which will enhance appeal in pediatric populations and increase compliance and patient acceptance of the dosage form.},

  abstract = {Assessing the material stiffness of fiber reinforced polymer composites deposited in Large Area Additive Manufacturing (LAAM) is needed to define the process-structure-property mapping for the LAAM technology. While the screw-extrusion-based LAAM systems yield a distribution of fiber aspect ratio (i.e., length to diameter ratio for cylindrical inclusions) within deposited beads, most composite micromechanical models ignore the fiber geometry variation and instead assume a single value of fiber aspect ratio. This paper presents a statistics-based homogenization approach for including the fiber aspect ratio distribution in the prediction of the elastic prop\- erties of an extruded polymer composite bead. The fiber length distribution of a 13 wt\% Carbon Fiber reinforced Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (CF-ABS) processed through a LAAM deposition system is measured using high resolution optical microscopy. The Weibull probability distribution function is employed to statistically describe the measured values. The fitted probability density function is then incorporated into a fiber orientation ho\- mogenization approach to compute the variability of the elastic properties of the extruded composite. Elastic properties predicted by our proposed method are shown to differ from those presented in prior studies that ignored fiber length variability. The fiber aspect ratio reduction from fiber length attrition during the LAAM single screw-extrusion is shown to decrease the predicted flow-direction effective elastic modulus by 7\%. Elastic moduli computed using our measured fiber aspect ratio distribution and proposed homogenization approach compare well to reported data from previously associated experimental studies.},

Extensional rheology measurement revealed the strain hardening of PET/iPP MRC is more obviously than iPP and with compatibilizer added. Scanning electron microscope observation indicated that the introduction of PP-g-GMA compatibilizer can improve the compatibility between PET and PP and subsequently lead to the decrease of diameter of PET microfibers. In addition, the incorporating of PP-g-GMA compatibilizer can also decrease the diameter and enhance the cell density of PET/iPP MRC cell. Both the tensile strength and the impact strength of the PET/iPP MRC foam are higher than that of the iPP foam, and improved with the compatibilizer added.},

  abstract = {RepRaps (self Replicating Rapid prototypers), which 3-D print objects using fused filament fabrication (FFF), have evolved rapidly since their open source introduction. These 3-D printers have primarily been limited to desktop sizes of volumes of \textasciitilde 8000 cm3, which has limited the attention of the scientific community to investigating deformation of common thermoplastics such as polylactic acid (PLA) used in FFF printing. The only existing physically relevant deformation model was expanded here to use a physics-based temperature gradient instead of a step function. This was necessary to generalize the model to 3-D printing in a room temperature environment without a heated chamber. The thermal equation was calibrated using thermal measurements and validated by measuring curvatures in printed objects. The results confirm that this is a valid model for predicting warpage of thin vertical walls of PLA. Additionally, the effect of annealing was examined. It was found that at a temperature of 50\textdegree C, no shrinkage or crystallization takes place, but at 90\textdegree C the PLA rapidly crystallizes to around 20\% crystallinity. This indicates that heated bed temperatures should be maintained at 50oC or lower to avoid print failure (premature substrate release) with PLA. At 90\textdegree C, the annealing is accompanied by a 5\% size decrease in both horizontal dimensions, but an 8\% increase in the vertical dimension. Thus, the volume decreased by only 3\%. This observation may lead to potential methods of improving slicing of printing large PLA objects with FFF.},

  abstract = {Fuse deposition modelling (FDM) has become a revolutionary manufacturing technology as it offers numerous advantages, including freedom of fabrication, mass customisation, fast prototyping, and cost-effectiveness. Thermoplastic material is commonly used as feedstock for FDM process. The current state of material development, the recycled plastic material also can be used as printing material for FDM machine. Expanded polystyrene (EPS) has been extensively used as packaging materials for many industries but rarely be recycled, as its relatively large volume with minimal weight is unconducive for transportation. This research aimed to utilize EPS waste and turn it into FDM feedstock. This research also aims to enhance the properties of recycled polystyrene (rPS) made from EPS waste by blending it with polypropylene (PP). Different ratios of rPS/PP blends were prepared and extruded into FDM filament using filament extruder. The formulated filaments were printed into specimen using FDM machine. This research found the filament made from rPS/PP blends can be printed into specimen with good printing quality if the nozzle temperature controlled at 240\textdegree{} C with 120 \% extrusion rate. With this printing parameter, the specimen printed with rPS/PP blend filament exhibit the greatest adhesion between the deposited layers without any visible voids or gaps. Besides, the printed specimen with rPS/PP blends possess lower tensile strength, but higher tensile modulus as compared to the printed specimen with neat rPS. The addition of more PP decreased both tensile strength and modulus of rPS/PP blends. On the other hand, the rPS/PP blends have higher thermal stability as the PP content increased. Overall, the rPS/PP blends filament shows a great potential as a feedstock material for FDM fabrication.},

  abstract = {The recent development of open-source 3-D printers makes scaling of distributed additive-based manufacturing of high-value objects technically feasible. These self-replicating rapid prototypers (RepRaps) can manufacture approximately half of their own parts from sequential fused deposition of polymer feedstocks. RepRaps have been proposed and demonstrated to be useful for conventional prototyping and engineering, customizing scientific equipment, and appropriate technology-related manufacturing for sustainable development. However, in order for this technology to proliferate like 2D electronic printers have, it must be economically viable for a typical household. This study reports on the life-cycle economic analysis (LCEA) of RepRap technology for an average U.S. household. A new low-cost RepRap is described and the costs of materials and time to construct it are quantified. The economic costs of a selection of twenty open-source printable designs (representing less than 0.04\% of those available), are typical of products that a household might purchase, are quantified for print time, energy, and filament consumption and compared to low and high Internet market prices for similar products without shipping costs. The results show that even making the extremely conservative assumption that the household would only use the printer to make the selected twenty products a year the avoided purchase cost savings would range from about \$300 to \$2000/year. Assuming the 25 hours of necessary printing for the selected products is evenly distributed throughout the year these savings provide a simple payback time for the RepRap in 4 months to 2 years and provide an ROI between {$>$}200\% and {$>$}40\%. As both upgrades and the components that are most likely to wear out in the RepRap can be printed and thus the lifetime of the distributing manufacturing can be substantially increased the unavoidable conclusion from this study is that the RepRap is an economically attractive investment for the average U.S. household already. It appears clear that as RepRaps improve in reliability, continue to decline in cost and both the number and assumed utility of open-source designs continues growing exponentially, open-source 3-D printers will become a mass-market mechatronic device.},

  abstract = {Distributed manufacturing even at the household level is now well established with the combined use of open source designs and self-replicating rapid prototyper (RepRap) 3-D printers. Previous work has shown substantial economic consumer benefits for producing their own polymer products. Now flexible filaments are available at roughly 3-times the cost of more conventional 3-D printing materials. To provide some insight into the potential for flexible filament to be both technically feasible and economically viable for distributed digital manufacturing at the consumer level this study investigates 20 common flexible household products. The 3-D printed products were quantified by print time, electrical energy use and filament consumption by mass to determine the cost to fabricate with a commercial RepRap 3-D printer. Printed parts were inspected and when necessary tested for their targeted application to ensure technical feasibility. Then, the experimentally measured cost to DIY manufacturers was compared to low and high market prices for comparable commercially available products. In addition, the mark-up and potential for long-term price declines was estimated for flexible filaments by converting thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) pellets into filament and reground TPE from a local recycling center into filament using an open source recyclebot. This study found that commercial flexible filament is economically as well as technically feasible for providing a means of distributed home-scale manufacturing of flexible products. The results found a 75\% savings when compared to the least expensive commercially equivalent products and 92\% when compared to high market priced products. Roughly, 160 flexible objects must be substituted to recover the capital costs to print flexible materials. However, as previous work has shown the Lulzbot Mini 3-D printer used in this study would provide more than a 100\% ROI printing one object a week from hard thermoplastics, the upgrade needed to provide flexible filament capabilities can be accomplished with 37 average substitution flexible prints. This, again easily provides a triple digit return on investment printing one product a week. Although these savings, which are created by printing objects at home are substantial, the results also have shown the savings could be further increased to 93\% when the use of a pellet extruder and TPE pellets, and 99\% if recycled TPE filament made with a recyclebot is used. The capital costs of a recyclebot can be recovered in the manufacturing of about 9 kg of TPE filament, which can be accomplished in less than a week, enabling improved environmental impact as well as a strong financial return for heavy 3-D printer users.},

  abstract = {In order to assist researchers explore the full potential of distributed recycling of post-consumer polymer waste, this article describes a recyclebot, which is a waste plastic extruder capable of making commercial quality 3-D printing filament. The device design takes advantage of both the open source hardware methodology and the paradigm developed by the open source self-replicating rapid prototyper (RepRap) 3-D printer community. Specifically, this paper describes the design, fabrication and operation of a RepRapable Recyclebot, which refers to the Recyclebot's ability to provide the filament needed to largely replicate the parts for the Recyclebot on any type of RepRap 3-D printer. The device costs less than \$700 in mate rials and can be fabricated in about 24\,h. Filament is produced at 0.4\,kg/h using 0.24\,kWh/kg with a diameter {$\pm$}4.6\%. Thus, filament can be manufactured from commercial pellets for {$<$}22\% of commercial filament costs. In addition, it can fabricate recycled waste plastic into filament for 2.5\,cents/kg, which is {$<$}1000X commercial filament costs. The system can fabricate filament from polymers with extrusion temperatures {$<$}250\,\textdegree C and is thus capable of manufacturing custom filament over a wide range of thermopolymers and composites for material science studies of new materials and recyclability studies, as well as research on novel applications of fused filament based 3-D printing.},

Introduction:  The first off-Earth fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printer will explore thermoplastic manufacturing capabilities in microgravity. This study evaluated the feasibility of FDM 3D printing 10 acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) thermoplastic surgical instruments on Earth.  Methods:  Three-point bending tests compared stiffness and yield strength between FDM 3D printed and conventionally manufactured ABS thermoplastic. To evaluate the relative speed of using four printed instruments compared to conventional instruments, 13 surgeons completed simulated prepping, draping, incising, and suturing tasks. Each surgeon ranked the performance of six printed instruments using a 5-point Likert scale.  Results:  At a thickness of 5.75 mm or more, the FDM printing process had a less than 10\% detrimental effect on the tested yield strength and stiffness of horizontally printed ABS thermoplastic relative to conventional ABS thermoplastic. Significant weakness was observed when a bending load was applied transversely to a 3D printed layer. All timed tasks were successfully performed using a printed sponge stick, towel clamp, scalpel handle, and toothed forceps. There was no substantial difference in time to completion of simulated surgical tasks with control vs. 3D printed instruments. Of the surgeons, 100\%, 92\%, 85\%, 77\%, 77\%, and 69\% agreed that the printed smooth and tissue forceps, curved and straight hemostats, tissue and right angle clamps, respectively, would perform adequately.  Discussion:  It is feasible to 3D print ABS thermoplastic surgical instruments on Earth. Load-bearing structures were designed to be thicker, when possible. Printing orientations were selected so that the printing layering direction of critical structures would not be transverse to bending loads.},

This study seeks to demonstrate the feasibility of using solar energy to power a FDM 3D printer to manufacture medical resources at the Mars Desert Research Station and to design an ultra-portable solar-powered 3D printer for off-grid environments. METHODS: Six solar panels in a 3\texttimes 2 configuration, a voltage regulator/capacitor improvised from a power adapter, and two 12V batteries in series were connected to power a FDM 3D printer. Three designs were printed onsite and evaluated by experts post analogue mission. A solar-powered 3D printer composed of off-the-shelf components was designed to be transported in airline carry-on luggage. RESULTS: During the analogue mission, the solar-powered printer could only be operated for {$<$}1 h/d, but was able to fabricate a functional dental tool, scalpel handle, and customized mallet splint over 2 d. Post analogue mission, an ultra-portable plug-and-play solar-powered 3D printer was designed that could print an estimated 16 dental tools or 8 mallet finger splints or 7 scalpel handles on one fully charged 12V 150Wh battery with a 110V AC converter. CONCLUSION: It is feasible to use solar energy to power a 3D printer to manufacture functional and personalized medical resources at a Mars analogue research station. Based on these findings, a solar-powered suitcase 3D printing system containing solar panels, 12V battery with charge controller and AC inverter, and back-up solar charge controller and inverter was designed for transport to and use in off-grid communities.},

  abstract = {Extending the useful life of materials through recycling has proven to be an efficient means of reducing natural resource use and limiting the production of waste. In the case of polymer-based materials, in general, and of packaging materials, in particular, material recovery is complicated by the presence of incompatible polymers, as well as a priori undesirable contaminants such as inorganic inclusions. This article investigated the recycling of multilayer packaging material systems, based on polypropylene and silicon oxide-coated poly(ethylene terephthalate). In particular, the effect of a compatibilization of the blend using maleic anhydride-grafted polypropylene on the mechanical properties of the recycled material was examined. Without a compatibilizer, and at low compatibilizer concentrations, the blend exhibits a coarse morphology and is brittle. At a concentration of 5\% wt of the compatibilizer, a fine morphology is obtained, and the blend shows excellent ductility. Beyond this concentration, a brittle interphase forms between the blend constituents, with a corresponding decrease in ductility. These results were confirmed by a study of strain-induced crystallization in the blend. Furthermore, the size of the SiOx inclusions, resulting from the fragmentation of the oxide coating during reprocessing, had no detectable influence on the mechanical properties of the recycled blend, providing that their concentration is lower than 2 \texttimes{} 10-3. This study showed that a control of both the microstructure and interface properties considerably improves the mechanical properties of the recycled material, leading to high added-value applications. \textcopyright{} 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

  abstract = {In attempts to produce modified poldified polyethlene terephthalate (PET) ressins with improved rheology for applications requiring high viscosity and elasticity (e.g., lowdensity extrusion foaming, extrusion blow molding), a novel dimidodiepoxide of low molecular weight was evaluated aschain extender/branching ageent. Its reactivity was compared with that of an ethylene/glycidy1 methacrylate copolymer. The diepoxide showed higher reactivity than the copolymer and could be used at muchlower concentrations. The complex chain extension/degradation reactions occurring in the melt were followed in a batch mixer by torque changes, and by analyzing the prouducts for residual carboxy1 and hydroxy1 content, intrinsic viscosity, insoluble content and melt viscoelastic properties. The perliminary results of this work indicated an overall decrease in carboxy1 content, increase in hydroxy1 content, increase in intrinsic viscosity ans melt viscosity and storage modulus values depending on mixing time and the type and concentration of the additive. It is shown that under certain conditions. reaction of PET with less than 1 wt\% diimidodiepoxide may produce materials with rheological characteristics similar to thouse of PET grades that are extrusion foamable by gas injection to low densities.},

The flow of a viscoelastic polymer filament from a nozzle, the deposition of the filament onto a substrata or previously deposited filaments, and the cooling and solidification of the filament, are captured using the one-fluid formulations, where a single set of equations is written for all the fluids and phases involved (polymer and air). The governing equations are solved on a regular stationary grid and the boundary between the polymer and the air is followed using connected marker points. The model is based on an earlier development where the polymer stresses were assumed to be Newtonian. The method is tested by simulating the extrusion of a polymer from a nozzle and the predicted swelling compared with results from the literature. The method is then used to simulate three filaments deposited on top of each other and the fabrication of an object consisting of a filament deposited perpendicularly on top of several filaments. The effect of including viscoelasticity on the extruded filament size and shape are discussed.},

PET and PC microfibrils exhibit different influences on the rheological behaviors of microfibrillar blends. The viscosity of the microfibrillar blends increases with increased PET and PC concentrations. Surprisingly, the length/diameter ratio of the microfibrils as a result of the hot stretch ratio (HSR) has an opposite influence on the rheological behavior of the two microfibrillar blends. The stretched PET/HDPE blend exhibits higher viscosity than the unstretched counterpart, while the stretched PC/HDPE blend exhibits lower viscosity than the unstretched blend. The data obtained in this study will be helpful for constructing a technical foundation for the recycling and utilization of PET, PC, and HDPE waste mixtures by manufacturing microfibrillar blends in the future.

Crystallization behavior and morphology of CMRB were systematically investigated. Scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) observations showed blurry interface of compatibilized common blend (CCB). The crystallization behavior of neat iPP, CCB, microfibrillar reinforced iPP/PET blend (MRB) and CMRB was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and polarized optical microscopy (POM). The increase of crystallization temperature and crystallization rate during nonisothermal crystallization process indicated both PET particles and microfibrils could serve as nucleating agents and PET microfibrils exhibited higher heterogeneous nucleation ability, which were also vividly revealed by results of POM. Compared with MRB sample, CMRB sample has lower crystallization temperature due to existence of PET microfibrils with smaller aspect ratio and wider distribution. In addition, since in situ compatibilizer tends to stay in the interphase, it could also hinder the diffusion of iPP molecules to the surface of PET phase, leading to decrease of crystallization rate. Two-dimensional wide-angle X-ray diffraction (2D-WAXD) was preformed to characterize the crystalline structure of the samples by injection molding, and it was found that well-developed PET microfibrils contained in MRB sample promoted formation of {$\beta$}-phase of iPP.},

Potential risks that are inevitably encountered with traditional methods include complications, secondary injuries, and limited source donors. Three-dimensional (3D) printing technology holds the potential to solve these limitations; it can be used to rapidly manufacture personalized tissue engineering scaffolds, repair tissue defects in situ with cells, and even directly print tissue and organs. Such printed implants and organs not only perfectly match the patient's damaged tissue, but can also have engineered material microstructures and cell arrangements to promote cell growth and differentiation. Thus, such implants allow the desired tissue repair to be achieved, and could eventually solve the donor-shortage problem. This review summarizes relevant studies and recent progress on four levels, introduces different types of biomedical materials, and discusses existing problems and development issues with 3D printing that are related to materials and to the construction of extracellular matrix in vitro for medical applications.},

The scaffolds for bone regeneration need to be mechanically stable and have a 3D architecture with interconnected pores. With the advances in additive manufacturing technology, these requirements can be fulfilled by 3D printing scaffolds with controlled geometry and porosity using a low-cost multistep process. The scaffolds, however, must also be bioactive to promote the environment for the cells to regenerate into bone tissue. To determine if a low-cost 3D printing method for bespoke SiOC(N) porous structures can regenerate bone these structures were tested for osteointegration potential by using human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). This includes checking the general biocompatibilities under the osteogenic differentiation environment (cell proliferation and metabolism). Moreover, cell morphology was observed by confocal microscopy and gene expressions on typical osteogenic markers at different stages for bone formation were determined by real-time PCR. The results of the study showed the pore size of the scaffolds had a significant impact on differentiation. A certain range of pore size could stimulate osteogenic differentiation, thus promoting bone regrowth and regeneration.},

Four types of iPP with different apparent viscosity were utilized to investigate the effect of viscosity ratio on the morphology and mechanical properties of PET/iPP microfibrillar blend. The morphological observation shows that the viscosity ratio is closely associated to the size of dispersed phase droplets in the original blends, and accordingly greatly affects the microfibrillation of PET. Lower viscosity ratio is favorable to formation of smaller and more uniform dispersed phase particles, thus leading to finer microfibrils with narrower diameter distribution. Addition of a compatibilizer, poly propylene-grafted-glycidyl methacrylate (PP-g-GMA), can increase the viscosity ratio and decrease the interfacial tension between PET and iPP, which tends to decrease the size of PET phase in the unstretched blends. After stretched, the aspect ratio of PET microfibrils in the compatibilized blends is considerably reduced compared to the uncompatibilized ones. The lower viscosity ratio brought out higher mechanical properties of the microfibrillar blends. Compared to the uncompatibilized microfibrillar blends, the tensile, flexural strength and impact toughness of the compatibilized ones are all improved.},

  abstract = {Multi-material fused deposition modeling (FDM) is an effective tool to realize the optimal design and manufacturing with various materials, but how to achieve an adequate level of interfacial bonding strength between dissimilar materials is still a critical problem. Herein, the influence of three multi-material FDM processing parameters, i.e. nozzle temperature, building stage temperature and printing speed, on the interfacial bonding strength of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU)/acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) bi-material structures was experimentally investigated. It was found that the interfacial bonding strength was significantly improved from 0.86 to 1.66\,MPa (increased by 93\%) when the building stage temperature increased from 30 to 68\,\textdegree C, which was the most effective processing parameter. Then, a heat transfer-based polymer inter-molecular diffusion theory was developed to understand the interfacial bonding mechanism. The interfacial temperature profiles during multi-material FDM process were experimentally measured by inserting thermocouples into printing specimens, and the theoretical model was well validated due to the good agreement between experimental and numerical data of interfacial temperature and bonding strength. The model provided an accurate prediction of interfacial bonding strength based on the understanding of thermally-driven diffusion of multi-material filaments; which would help improving the mechanical properties of products fabricated by multi-material FDM.},

  abstract = {Reclaimed materials such as waste plastics can be utilized in additive manufacturing to improve the self-reliance of warfighters on forward operating bases by cutting costs and decreasing the demand for the frequent resupplying of parts by the supply chain. In addition, the use of waste materials in additive manufacturing in the private sector would reduce cost and increase sustainability, providing a high-value output for used plastics. Experimentation is conducted to process polyethylene terephthalate bottles and packaging into filament that can then be used for additive manufacturing methods like fused filament fabrication, without the use of additives or modification to the polymer. The chemistry of different polyethylene terephthalate recycled feedstocks was evaluated and found to be identical, and thus mixed feedstock processing is a suitable approach. Rheological data showed drying of the recycled polyethylene terephthalate led to an increase in the polymer's viscosity. Thermal and mechanical properties were evaluated for filament with different processing conditions, as well as printed and molded specimens. Crystallinity ranged from 12.2 for the water cooled filament, compared to 24.9\% for the filament without any active cooling. Tensile results show that the elongation to failure was similar to an injection molded part (3.5\%) and tensile strength of 35.1 {$\pm$} 8 MPa was comparable to commercial polycarbonate-ABS filament, demonstrating the robustness of the material. In addition, three point bending tests showed a similar load at failure for a select long-lead military part printed from the recycled filament compared to parts printed from commercial filament. Thus filament from recycled polyethylene terephthalate has the capability for replacing commercial filament in printing a diverse range of plastic parts.},

  abstract = {Consumer-grade plastics can be considered a low-cost and sustainable feedstock for fused filament fabrication (FFF) additive manufacturing processes. Such materials are excellent candidates for distributed manufacturing, in which parts are printed from local materials at the point of need. Most plastic waste streams contain a mixture of polymers, such as water bottles and caps comprised of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene (PP), and complete separation is rarely implemented. In this work, blends of waste PET, PP and polystyrene (PS) were processed into filaments for 3D printing. The effect of blend composition and styrene ethylene butylene styrene (SEBS) compatibilizer on the resulting mechanical and thermal properties were probed. Recycled PET had the highest tensile strength at 35 {$\pm$} 8 MPa. Blends of PP/PET compatibilized with SEBS and maleic anhydride functionalized SEBS had tensile strengths of 23 {$\pm$} 1 MPa and 24 {$\pm$} 1 MPa, respectively. The noncompatibilized PP/PS blend had a tensile strength of 22 {$\pm$} 1 MPa. PP/PS blends exhibited reduced tensile strength to ca. 19 {$\pm$} 1\textendash 3 MPa with the addition of SEBS. Elongation to failure was generally improved for the blended materials compared to neat recycled PET and PS. The glass transition was shifted to higher temperatures for all of the blends except the 50\textendash 50 wt. \% PP/PET blend. Crystallinity was decreased for the blends, but was highest in the 75\textendash 25 wt. \% PP/PS and the 50-50 wt. \% PP/PET blend with SEBS-maleic anhydride. Solvent extraction of the dispersed phase revealed polypropylene was the matrix phase in both the 50\textendash 50 wt. \% PP/PET and PP/PS blends.},

Recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET) has been shown to be a robust material for material extrusion additive manufacturing, with mechanical properties comparable with acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene. However, due to PET's high crystallinity, it is generally a brittle material and can be subject to premature fracture. It is well known that the addition of rubbers can serve to toughen PET. In this work, micronized rubber powder, as well as non-reactive and functionalized styrene-ethylene-butadiene-styrene (SEBS) elastomers were compounded with recycled PET. Tensile strength was not significantly affected, but toughness increased 85\% with the addition of 5 wt\% rubber, 350\% with SEBS and over 550\% with maleic anhydride functionalized SEBS compared to neat recycled PET.

  abstract = {Both polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) constitute a significant portion of post-consumer waste. To improve the recycling of immiscible PP/PET blends, a compatibiliser should be utilised. The steady shear flow properties of unmodified and modified PP/PET blends having up to 50 wt.\% PET were investigated and compared in this study. Three types of PPs with different flow properties were used to ascertain the influence of the matrix on the blend's rheology. The effect of modification on the rheological properties was evaluated in two ways - firstly, the addition of 1 wt.\% of maleic anhydride (MA), and secondly, the use of already modified polypropylene. According to the morphological observations, an improvement in compatibility was found in both cases., The shear viscosity and the first normal stress difference were measured using a rotational cone and plate rheometer at 265\textdegree C (when both PET and PP are molten), and 245\textdegree C (when only PP has melted). Completely different behaviour was observed under these two temperature conditions. At 265\textdegree C, the shear viscosity decreases with PET content in the blend, while at 245\textdegree C it increases, thus recalling the behaviour of particle-filled systems. The addition of maleic anhydride affects the shear viscosity in various ways; a decrease, an increase, and some almost unchanged values were obtained. Concerning the first normal stress difference, an even more complex situation occurs, and the effect of modification by MA is also ambiguous. Furthermore, the deviations from the log-additivity rule were evaluated in terms of the shear viscosity and the first normal stress difference. From the results, it can be supposed that PP-X/PET samples were compatibilised successfully, and strong interphase interactions could be expected. Finally, the yield values of shear stress determined at 245\textdegree C showed a generally increasing tendency with increasing PET content.},

  abstract = {The increasing amount of post-consumer waste leads to a search for effective recycling methods. Compatibilisation of immiscible blends of polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) represents one such novel approach that allows recycling of significant scrap materials without any need for separation steps. The intention of this paper is to investigate the dynamic viscoelastic properties of unmodified and modified PP/PET blends. To study the effect of the matrix, three polypropylenes differing in flow properties were chosen. The compatibilisation was carried out by both one- or two-step reactive in situ techniques. In the former case, the addition of 1 wt.\% of maleic anhydride, and in the latter, polypropylene supplied already modified by the producer were employed. The measurements were performed by using a rotational cone and plate rheometer at temperatures of 265 \textdegree C and 245 \textdegree C. Since PET is not melted at the lower temperature, completely different behaviour is observed in the two cases. The rheological functions generally decrease with PET content at 265 \textdegree C (conventional blend behaviour), while they increase at 245 \textdegree C, in a manner reminiscent particle-filled systems (including the yield behaviour). The positive effect of compatibilisation can be deduced not only from the results of the morphological study (dispersed phase size reduction, strengthened interfacial adhesion), but also through increased values of the viscous and elastic characteristics, which suggests enhanced interactions between the blend components. Comparing steady shear and dynamic viscoelastic properties, the extent of deformation applied during both types of measurements leading to different material responses should be considered.},

  abstract = {Polymer blend compatibilization is an attractive solution for mechanical recycling of mixed plastic waste because it can result in tough blends. In this work, hydroxy-telechelic polyethylene (HOPEOH) reactive additives were used to compatibilize blends of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE). HOPEOH additives were synthesized with molar masses of 1\textendash 20 kg/mol by ring-opening metathesis polymerization of cyclooctene followed by catalytic hydrogenation. Melt-compounded blends containing 0.5 wt \% HOPEOH displayed reduced dispersed phase LLDPE particle sizes with ductilities comparable to virgin PET and almost seven times greater than neat blends, regardless of additive molar mass. In contrast, analogous blends containing monohydroxy PE additives of comparable molar masses did not result in compatibilization even at 2 wt \% loading. The results strongly suggest that both hydroxy ends of HOPEOH undergo transesterification reactions during melt mixing with PET to form predominantly PET\textendash PE\textendash PET triblock copolymers at the interface of the dispersed and matrix phases. We hypothesize that the triblock copolymer compatibilizers localized at the interface form trapped entanglements of the PE midblocks with nearby LLDPE homopolymer chains by a hook-and-clasp mechanism. Finally, HOPEOH compounds were able to efficiently compatibilize blends derived solely from postconsumer PET and PE bottles and film, suggesting their industrial applicability.},

The effect of SEBS content was investigated using scanning electron microscope, differential scanning calorimeter, dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), and mechanical property testing. Morphology observation showed that the addition of 10 wt \% SEBS led to the deformation of dispersed phase from spherical to fibrous structure, and microfibrils were formed at the interface between two phases in the compatibilized blends. Both differential scanning calorimeter and DMA results revealed that the blend with 20 wt \% SEBS showed better compatibility between PET and LLDPE than other blends studied. The addition of 20 wt \% of SEBS obviously improved the crystallizibility of PET as well as the modulus of the blends. DMA analysis also showed that the interaction between SEBS and two other components enhanced at high temperature above 130\textdegree C. The impact strength of the blend with 20 wt \% SEBS increased of 93.2\% with respect to the blend without SEBS, accompanied by only a 28.7\% tensile strength decrease. \textcopyright{} 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The crystallization behavior, mechanical properties and microphotographs of r-PET/compatibilizer, r-PET/PP bleds and its compatibilized versions were characterized. The results indicated that addition of compatibilizer decreased the tensile and flexural strength of r-PET and slightly improve its impact strength. The introduction of r-PET to PP matrix increased the tensile and flexural strength of PP. The tensile and flexural strength of compatibilized r-PET/PP are dependent on the kinds of compatibilizers. Addition of PP-g-MA improved the tensile and flexural strength of r-PET/PP blends and introduction of POE-g-MA or EVA-g-MA increased the impact strength of r-PET/PP blends. Effect of compatibilizer and its mixtures and r-PET content on the mechanical properties of compatibilized r-PET/PP blends is discussed. The r-PET/PP blends with high strength and toughness can be obtained by compatibilization of the mixtures of PP-g-MA and POE-g-MA (or EVA-g-MA).

The results show that the interfacial bonding strength can be availably tailored by the filling density and cooling rate. An unusual and interesting phenomenon was also observed that the interfacial bonding strength firstly increases to an optimal value and then decreases as the filling density increases. Both the experimental observations and SCFT calculations revealed that the better strength of interfacial adhesion is mainly attributed to the larger width of wetted interface and degree of inter-molecular diffusion between two adjacent layers. The critical mechanism behind the controllable interfacial adhesion strength of polymer-on-polymer surfaces were precisely clarified.

  abstract = {Polymer acceptors for high-efficiency all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) are generally semicrystalline. In this manuscript, we report an amorphous polymer acceptor, which matches well with a variety of polymer donors to produce efficient all-PSCs. The amorphous polymer acceptor (rr-PBN) is a regiorandom polymer consisting of alternating asymmetric B{$\leftarrow$}N bridged thienylthiazole (BNTT) unit and pyridine-flanked diketopyrrolopyrrole (PyDPP) unit. It is amorphous in thin film because of its regiorandom structure and the large steric hindrance. rr-PBN shows deep LUMO/HOMO energy levels of -3.71/\textendash 5.81 eV, strong sunlight harvesting capability and high electron mobility of 2.20 \texttimes{} 10\textendash 4 cm2 V\textendash 1 s\textendash 1. As a polymer acceptor, rr-PBN matches well with three commercially available polymer donors, J71, PTB7-Th, and PffBT4T-2OD to give excellent percolating bicontinuous network morphology in all-PSCs. We propose that the crystallization of polymer donors governs the film-forming process and dominates the phase separation morphology, leading to good phase separation morphology. The all-PSC devices all show power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 5.2\textendash 6.6\%. This study provides a new direction to design polymer acceptors and a novel approach to control phase separation morphology of all-PSCs.},

The crystallization morphology, nonisothermal crystallization and melting behavior, crystallization kinetics, and isothermal crystallization kinetics were investigated with differential scanning calorimetry. The results indicated that the wasted fabric (WF) had a heterogeneous nucleation effect on PP in the composites, and this increased the crystallization temperature and induced PP to form transcrystallinity. PP-g-MA further increased the crystallization temperature; however, the reactive monomers weakened the heterogeneous nucleation effect of WF. Also, the premelting temperature affected the crystallization and melting behavior of the composites significantly. The Avrami equation and the Mo method provided a fairly satisfactory description of the crystallization kinetics. The crystallization activation energy, nucleation constant, and folding surface free energy of PP were markedly reduced in the PP/waste PET fabric composites and the compatibilized composites. \textcopyright{} 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In this study plastic waste is upcycled into 3-D printing filament with a recyclebot, which is an open source waste plastic extruder. The recyclebot is combined with an open source self-replicating rapid prototyper (RepRap) 3-D printer, to enable post-consumer ABS plastic filament from computer waste to be further upcycled into valuable consumer products pre-designed in the digital commons. The total electrical energy consumption for the combined process is monitored and an economic evaluation is completed. The coupled distributed recycling and manufacturing method for complex products reduces embodied energy by half, while reducing the cost of consumer products to pennies. This economic benefit provides an incentive for consumers to both home recycle and home manufacture, which tightens the loop on the circular economy by eliminating waste associated from transportation and retail. It is clear from the results that waste plastic can be significantly upcycled at the individual level using this commons-based approach. This tightening of the loop of the circular economy benefits the environment and sustainability as well as the economic stability of consumers/prosumers.},

The non-isothermal crystallization kinetics and the crystallization morphologies are investigated by differential scanning calorimetry and polarized optical microscopy (POM), respectively. The crystallization temperature and rate of the binary blend increase during the non-isothermal crystallization process, indicating that rPET phase has nucleation ability for crystallization of the PP matrix. However, the crystallization temperatures and rates of the ternary blends slightly decrease because of the chemical reaction between MAH and the rPET terminal groups. Applying the equations proposed by Jeziorny, Ozawa, and Mo to analyze the non-isothermal crystallization kinetics of pure PP and PP in the binary and ternary PP/rPET blends, agreement is found between the experimental results and Mo method. The crystallization activation energy increases in the binary PP/rPET blend, which is ascribed to the confinement effect on the motion of the PP chains by large rPET particles, and this confinement effect is mitigated with the inclusion of PP-g-MAH/DAP. POM observation confirms the heterogeneous nucleation of rPET on PP and the restriction of crystallization of PP by the incorporation of PP-g-MAH/DAP.},

The PP/recycled polyethylene terephthalate (rPET) blends with and without PP-g-MAH/DAP (PP grafted with both MAH and DAP) are conducted on a twin-screw extruder. It reveals that the introduction of DAP can significantly enhance the grafting degree of MAH and decrease the chain scission of PP. The maximum extent of MAH grafting (1.5~wt.\%) is obtained when DCP and MAH contents are 0.5 and 6.0~wt.\%, respectively, and the DAP/MAH molar ratio is 0.3. Besides, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis shows that the crystallization temperature of grafted PP is higher than that of pure PP due to the nucleation of grafted groups. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis proves that chemical reactions take place between PP-g-MAH/DAP and rPET. In particular, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations demonstrate that, the PP/rPET blends compatibilized with PP-g-MAH/DAP show enhanced adhesion at the interface comparing with the binary PP/rPET blend, which is also proved by DSC measurements, dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and mechanical properties.},

Although a few articles in literature and commercial software have been devoted to developing tree-supports, those tree-supports are generated based on geometry optimization or user-defined parameters, which cannot guarantee a minimum volume with robust fabrication guarantee. To address this issue, we propose a set of formulas for stably growing the tree-supports with physical constraints based on 3D printing experiments using fused decomposition modelling (FDM) machines, and a volume minimization mechanism using a hybrid of particle swarm optimization (PSO) method and a greedy algorithm. We show that this combination is effective in reducing the volume of tree-supports and the simulations reveal that the volume curves monotonically descent to a constant within a short time, and our experimental results show that the models with the tree-supports can be manufactured stably.},

The mechanical properties of these blends have been found to be specifically dependent upon composition as well as morphological phase characteristics. Variation of these factors can result in four different levels of impact and elongation to break properties.
